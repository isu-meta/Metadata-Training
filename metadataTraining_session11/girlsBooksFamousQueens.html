<h2>SEMIRAMIS.<br>

<small>2069 B.C.</small></h2>

</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE name of Semiramis is associated with the story of
Nineveh’s glory, and the building of the mighty city
of Babylon. And though historians differ widely regarding
the time of her famous reign, and some even express
doubts whether she ever really existed, holding that her
story was a mythological legend, her name is too illustrious
to be passed over in silence, and her deeds too remarkable
to be ignored, if she did in truth live; and if
the story is a mere legend, it is, moreover, so interwoven
with historical records as to deserve mention.</p>

<p>The date we have chosen from among many, covering
more than a thousand years, is the date of the founding of
Nineveh by Ninus, who was said to be the son of the mighty
Nimrod, whom some say founded this great city; his son
only embellishing it. Rollin states that Nimrod was probably
the famous Belus of the Babylonians, afterwards
deified by the people and worshipped under the name of
Baal.</p>

<p>The birth of Semiramis, the celebrated queen of
Assyria, is shrouded in mystery. Legends say that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
was born at Ascalon, a city of Syria, and that she was
the daughter of the goddess Derceto, and that her father
was an Assyrian youth of striking beauty. Being deserted
by her mother, she was fed by doves in the desert; and
when she was about a year old, a shepherd named Simmas
found the infant in a rocky place, and he adopted the
foundling as his child, calling her Semiramis.</p>

<p>When she had grown to maidenhood, she was remarkable
for her great beauty, and was also possessed of an unusual
intelligence. Menones, the governor of Nineveh, having
on one occasion been sent by King Ninus to inspect his
Syrian flocks, beheld this beautiful maiden at the shepherd’s
dwelling, and being intensely pleased by her marvellous
beauty, made her his wife. So great a power did
Semiramis obtain over her husband Menones, that he was
soon completely subject to her wishes, and so much did
he respect her judgment that he sought her advice upon
every project. King Ninus previously to this time had
subjugated in seventeen years all the nations of Asia,
with the exception of the Indians and the Bactrians. He
had conquered Babylonia, Armenia, Media, Egypt, Phœnicia,
Cœle Syria, Cilicia, Lycia, Lydia, Mysia, Phrygia,
Bithynia, Cappadocia, and reduced the nations on the
Pontus as far as the Tanais. Then he made himself
master of the land of the Cadusians and Tapyrians, of
the Hyrcanians, Drangians, Derbiccians, Carmanians,
Chorasmians, Barcians, and Parthians. He also conquered
Persia, Susiana, and Caspiana. Ninus then determined
to build a mighty city, and so he founded Nineveh,
or finished the work which his father had begun.</p>

<p>This city was built on the bank of the river Tigris. The
circumference of the city was sixty miles, and it was surrounded
by walls one hundred feet high, and so broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
that three chariots might ride abreast upon the top. The
walls were fortified with fifteen hundred towers, each two
hundred feet high. When this great city was completed,
King Ninus determined to march against the Bactrians,
who yet withstood his power. According to the accounts
of Ctesias and Diodorus, his army numbered 1,700,000
foot-soldiers, 210,000 cavalry, and about 10,600 chariots
of war. The narrowness of the passes which protect the
entrance to Bactria forced Ninus to divide his forces.
The king of the Bactrians met him with 400,000 men.
The Assyrians were successful in forcing their way into
the country, but they suffered great loss. At length all
of the cities were captured except Bactria, the chief city,
where was the palace of the king. Ninus now besieged
this city, and Menones, who was one of the chief counsellors
of the king, sent for his wife Semiramis to come
to the camp. Semiramis seized this favorable opportunity
to display her power. She clothed herself in peculiar
garments, so that it could not be ascertained whether she
was a man or a woman; and this style of robe at a later
day became the costume of the Medes and Persians.
When she arrived in the camp, she perceived that the
attack was directed chiefly against that part of the city
lying in the plain, and not against the citadel; and she
also perceived that this caused the Bactrians to guard
their fortifications with less vigilance. She thereupon
made selection of a body of troops who were accustomed
to climbing, and led them in person to the attack of the
citadel. This she captured, and then signalled to the
army below in the plains. The Bactrians, perceiving that
their citadel was taken, made weak resistance, and the city
was conquered. King Ninus so admired the daring courage
of this beautiful woman who had gained for him such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
a victory, that he determined to make her his wife, and
offered his own daughter to Menones, in exchange for his
wife Semiramis. But Menones was too much attached
to his wife to relinquish her to another, and then Ninus
threatened to put out the eyes of Menones unless he would
consent to this arrangement. The unhappy Menones,
overcome with jealous love and fear, hung himself in despair,
and King Ninus then married Semiramis. Accounts
differ regarding the death of Ninus, which placed Semiramis
upon this powerful throne. According to some,
Ninus died after reigning fifty-two years, and bequeathed
to her the sovereign power, their young son, Ninyas,
being too young to reign. Others state that Ninus, at the
request of Semiramis, granted to his young and beautiful
wife the absolute sovereignty of his empire for five days.
The young queen of twenty was seated upon the royal
throne, the signet ring was placed upon her finger, and
all the provinces of the realm were commanded to do her
reverence, and obey implicitly her decrees.</p>

<p>Semiramis, having thus secured supreme authority,
made most ungrateful and wicked use of her power. She
thereupon commanded her husband to be imprisoned,
and afterwards put to death; and then declared herself
his successor, and reigned alone during the remainder of
her life. Whether she killed her husband or not, she is
said to have erected for him a magnificent tomb adjoining
the famous Tower of Belus, and adorned it with statues
of massive gold.</p>

<p>She now resolved to immortalize her name by the erection
of marvellous monuments, and undertaking mighty
and difficult enterprises. She determined to surpass the
fame of Ninus; and accordingly undertook the founding,
or embellishment, of the great city of Babylon, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
work she is said to have employed two millions of
men.</p>

<p>The foundation of Babylon had already been commenced
by the builders of the famous Tower of Babel. Among
the works in Babylon attributed to Semiramis, are the
walls and towers and citadels; the bridge over the
Euphrates, the temple of Belus, and the excavation of
the lake to draw off the waters of the Euphrates. She
is said to have founded other cities on the Euphrates and
Tigris. She built huge aqueducts, connected various
cities by roads and highways, in the construction of which
she was forced to level mountains and fill up valleys.
She is said to have marched with a large army to Media,
and planted the garden near Mount Bagistanon. This
mountain is more than ten thousand feet high, and she
caused its steep face to be smoothed, and on it her picture
was cut, surrounded by one hundred guards. She afterwards
made another large garden near the city of Chauon,
in Media, and in the midst of it, upon a high rock, she
erected a splendid palace, in which she remained for a
long time. In Ecbatana she also built a magnificent
palace; and in order to provide the city with water, she
caused a tunnel to be cut through the base of the lofty
mountain Orontes, to a lake lying upon its further side.
The following is one of the many inscriptions she caused
to be carved upon the monuments of her power and surprising
greatness.</p>

<p>“Nature bestowed on me the form of a woman; my
actions have surpassed those of the most valiant of men.
I ruled the empire of Ninus, which stretched eastward
as far as the river Hyhanam, southward to the land of
incense and of myrrh, and northward to the country of
the Scythians and Sogdians. Before me, no Assyrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
had seen the great sea. I beheld with my own eyes four
seas, and their shores acknowledged my power. I constrained
the mighty rivers to flow according to my will,
and I led their waters to fertilize lands that had been
before barren and without inhabitants. I raised impregnable
towers; I constructed paved roads in ways hitherto
untrodden but by the beast of the forests; and in the
midst of these mighty works I found time for pleasure
and for friendship.”</p>

<p>Semiramis was very vigilant and daring in the administration
of her government. It is related that one morning,
when she was making her toilet, it was reported to
her that a revolt had broken out among a portion of the
citizens. She immediately rushed forth, half-attired,
with hair floating in disorder, and bravely faced the tumultuous
crowd of rioters. Her presence and eloquence
quickly appeased their fury, and then she returned and
calmly finished her toilet.</p>

<p>At length she determined to subjugate India. For two
years she made preparations for this expedition. Her
army consisted of 3,000,000 foot-soldiers, 500,000 horsemen,
and 100,000 chariots. As the Indians were famous
for their vast numbers of elephants which they used in
battle, which were considered almost invincible, Semiramis
determined to endeavor to overcome this obstacle
by stratagem. She accordingly ordered 100,000 camels
to be covered with the sewn skins of black oxen, in imitation
of elephants; and each animal was mounted by
a warrior. For crossing the Indus, 2,000 ships were
built, and then taken to pieces and strapped on the backs
of camels, while travelling on land. Stabrobates, the
king of the Indians, had raised a mighty force to meet
her. As Semiramis approached his realm, he sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
messengers to her to inquire why she was making war
upon him, and demanding to know who she was who
thus dared to invade his kingdom. The haughty Assyrian
queen replied, “Go to your king, and tell him I
will myself inform him who I am and why I am come
hither.”</p>

<p>In the first contest Semiramis was victorious, and she
took 100,000 prisoners; a thousand ships of the Indians
were sunk in the Indus. But the Indian king, pretending
flight, led the army of Semiramis after him. Having
caused a large bridge to be built over the Indus, Semiramis
landed her entire army on the other side, and with
her mock elephants in front of her forces, she pursued
the retreating Indians. At first the Indians were alarmed
by these false elephants; but finding out the stratagem,
the king of India turned, and attacking Semiramis with
his real elephants, her troops were put to flight, and she
herself was wounded by an arrow and javelin thrown by
the Indian king, who was mounted on his largest elephant.
Semiramis and the remnant of her army hastened across
the Indus; and as Stabrobates had been warned by seers
not to cross the river, they came to terms of capitulation,
and exchanged prisoners. Then Semiramis returned to
Assyria with only one-third of her army left.</p>

<p>When she arrived again within the borders of her own
kingdom, she was informed that her son Ninyas had conspired
against her. As the oracle in the temple of Jupiter
Ammon had previously declared that when her son should
conspire against her, she would disappear from the sight
of mortals and be received among the immortals, this
news occasioned no resentment against Ninyas; but she
immediately abdicated the throne and transferred the
kingdom to him, and is said to have put herself to death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
as though according to the oracle she had raised herself
to the gods. Others relate that she was reported to have
been changed into a dove, and thereupon flew out of the
palace with a flock of doves. Wherefore, the Assyrians
regard Semiramis as an immortal, and the dove as sacred
to divinity. She was sixty-two years of age, having
reigned forty-two years.</p>

<p>The following is one of the inscriptions in which she
gives her own genealogy, claiming celestial origin. She
is said to have inscribed her name and praises of her own
greatness upon many of the monuments she erected to
immortalize herself.</p>

<p>This amusing catalogue of high-sounding ancestors
may not seem so very ridiculous in view of the supposition
that she never did exist as a mortal, but that her
name and exploits have come down through the legends
of poetry. For it is stated by some authorities that the
story of Semiramis, as related by Ctesias, from which
source Diodorus takes his account, was founded upon
Medo-Persian poems sung by the minstrels of Media and
Persia, and that these poems represent the Assyrians
as worshipping a female deity, who was called Istar-Bilit,
the war-goddess, and also goddess of love. Istar of
Arbela was the goddess of battle, and Istar of Nineveh
was the goddess of love. Doves were sacred to her, and
in the temples of Syria there were statues of this goddess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
with a golden dove on her head. She was invoked
there under the name of Semiramis, a word meaning “high
name.” Thus the Medo-Persian minstrels have changed
the legend of an Assyrian goddess into a heroine, and
made her the founder of the Assyrian empire, just as
Greek poets represent their heroes as children of the
Immortals of Olympus.</p>

<p>Whether the story of Semiramis is a fabulous legend,
or whether she is really a historical character, is rather
difficult to determine; but her supposed exploits are so
interwoven with Assyrian and Babylonian history that
most authorities give her a prominent historical place;
and if half of her marvellous deeds are true, she must
without doubt hold an illustrious place amongst the
famous queens of ancient history.</p>

<h2>DIDO.<br>

<small>937 B.C.</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As on the banks of Eurotas, or on Mount Cynthus’ top, Diana
leads her train of mountain nymphs, bearing her quiver on her
shoulder, and moving majestic, she towers above the other goddesses;
such Dido was, and such, with cheerful grace, she passed
amid her train, urging forward the labor of founding and enlarging
her mighty kingdom.”—<span class="smcap">Virgil.</span></p></div>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE are two accounts given of the famous Queen
Dido. According to the historian Justin, Dido,
called also Elissa, was the daughter of Belus II., king of
Tyre. Ithobal, king of Tyre, and father of the famous
Jezebel, called in Scripture Ethbaal, was said to have
been her great-grandfather. Upon the death of Dido’s
father, her brother Pygmalion came to the throne. Dido
married her maternal uncle, Acerbas, who is also called
Sichæus by Virgil. Acerbas was the priest of Hercules,
an office next in rank to that of king.</p>

<p>This priest possessed immense treasures which King
Pygmalion desired to secure, and thereupon he assassinated
Acerbas whilst the priest was officiating at the altar.
Dido, who was greatly attached to her husband, was horrified
at her brother’s atrocious wickedness, and inconsolable
in her great loss. She immediately determined to
flee from Tyre, and take with her the treasures of her
husband, that they might not fall into the hands of the
avaricious murderer. Having secretly collected quite a
number of followers, Dido embarked in a fleet, and sailed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
from Tyre. Pygmalion, fearing that he would lose the
coveted treasures, sent messengers to his sister begging
her to return. The ships of Pygmalion’s ambassadors
having overtaken Dido, they delivered to her the request
of the king. Dido apparently assented, but took the precaution
when embarking to place in her ship, in the presence
of Pygmalion’s messengers, several bales filled with
sand, which she informed them contained the treasures.
When they were out at sea, Dido commanded her attendants
to throw these bales into the sea; and then representing
to those who had come from the monarch that
only death awaited them, should they return to Pygmalion
without the treasure, which they now supposed was buried
in the ocean, she induced them to become her companions
in her flight. Thereupon large numbers of the chief men
joined her party. Dido, with her fleet, sailed first to Cyprus,
which island had belonged to the dominions of her
father, who had conquered it. Here she was met by the
priest of Jupiter, and together with his entire family, he
joined her expedition, in obedience to the supposed will of
the gods. Dido also took on board her fleet eighty maidens
of Cyprus, who afterwards married her Tyrian subjects.</p>

<p>Having been driven by a storm on to the coast of
Africa, Dido bargained with the inhabitants for the purchase
of some land upon which to make a settlement.
The natives, fearful of the power of these new neighbors,
would only consent to sell such a portion of land as could
be covered by a bull’s hide. But the wily Dido was not
to be thus baffled; and conceding to their terms with
apparent willingness, she cut the hide of the bull into
long and slender thongs, thus being able to enclose with
them a large portion of ground. The space thus purchased
was hence called <i>Byrsa</i>, from the Greek word, meaning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
“a hide,” though some writers contend that the name of
Byrsa, the citadel of Carthage, was derived from the
Punic term <i>Basra</i>, “a fortification.” Around this first
settlement the city of Carthage arose, and Byrsa became
the citadel of the place.</p>

<p>It is said, that when the foundations were dug, a horse’s
head was found, which was thought to be a good omen,
and a presage of the future warlike genius of the people.
After this Tyrian colony had become established, the fame
of their queen, Dido, gained for her many suitors. But
she refused all their offers, having made a vow that she
would remain faithful to the memory of her husband,
Acerbas. At length, Iarbas, king of Mauritania, sought
her hand in marriage, and threatened war if his offers
were rejected. Justin thus tells the story:—</p>

<p>Iarbas, sending for ten of the principal Carthaginians,
demanded Dido in marriage, threatening to declare war
against her in case of refusal. The ambassadors, being
afraid to deliver the message of Iarbas to their queen,
told her with Punic honesty, that he wanted to have some
person sent him who was capable of civilizing and polishing
himself and his Africans, but that there was no
possibility of finding any Carthaginian who would be
willing to leave his place and kindred, for the conversation
of barbarians, who were as savage as the wildest
beasts. Here the queen, with indignation interrupting
them, and asking if they were not ashamed to refuse
living in any manner which might be beneficial to their
country, to which they owed even their lives, they then
delivered the king’s message, and bade her set them a
pattern, and sacrifice herself to her country’s welfare.
Dido being thus ensnared, called on Sichæus with tears
and lamentations, and answered that she would go where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the fate of her city called her. She demanded three
months for consideration. During this interval she
caused a large funeral pile to be erected, as if for the
purpose of offering a propitiatory sacrifice to the manes
of Acerbas. At the expiration of the time allotted she
ascended the fatal pile, and with her last breath told the
spectators that she was going to her husband, as they
had ordered her. She then plunged a dagger into her
heart, before they realized her fatal intention.</p>

<p>This action procured for her the name of <i>Dido</i>, a
“heroine” or “valiant woman,” her previous name having
been Elissa; though some authorities declare that
<i>Dido</i> neither denotes the “heroine,” as Servius maintains;
nor the “man-slayer,” as Eustathius pretends;
nor the “wanderer,” as other writers claim; but the
name <i>Dido</i> means nothing more than “the beloved,”
whether the reference be to Baal or to her husband. The
other appellation, Elissa, is said to mean “the exulting,”
or “joyous one,” though Bochart claims that it signifies
“the divine maiden.”</p>

<p>Her subjects after her death paid her divine honors.</p>

<p>Thus authorities differ as much over Dido’s name as
accounts differ regarding her life. Virgil’s poetical version
of the story deviates quite materially from the historical
narrative of Justin; but as Virgil’s famous poem
of the Æneid has obtained such world-wide fame, and
gained a lasting place in classic literature, his story of
Dido is too important to pass by unnoticed, and may be
thus briefly narrated. According to Virgil’s account,
Dido flourished about the time of the Trojan War, whereas
historians place her 247 years later in history, or about
937 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Dunlop, in his History of Roman Literature, says:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
“Virgil wrote at such a distance of time from the events
which formed the groundwork of his poem, and the
events themselves were so obscure, that he could depart
from history without violating probability. Thus it
appears from chronology that Dido lived nearly three
hundred years after the Trojan War; but the point was
one of obscure antiquity, known perhaps to few readers,
and not very precisely ascertained. Hence, so far was
the violence offered to chronology from revolting his
countrymen, that Ovid, who was so knowing in ancient
histories and fables, wrote an heroic epistle as addressed
by Dido to Æneas.”</p>

<p>The reason of Dido’s death is also differently stated by
Virgil. But, notwithstanding these great and unreconcilable
discrepancies, no one can fail to enjoy the charming
story of Dido as related by the gifted poet.</p>

<p>After the fall of Troy, as narrated by the Greek poet
Homer in the Iliad, the city was taken by the stratagem
of the wooden horse. Priam, the old king of Troy, was
slain by Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles; Paris, the son of
Priam, having previously killed the great Achilles by the
shot of an arrow in his heel, as Hector had prophesied at
his death. After the death of Paris, Helen married Deiphobus,
his brother, and at the taking of Troy betrayed
him, in order to reconcile herself to Menelaüs, her first
husband, who received her again into favor. Homer continues
the story of Ulysses in the Odyssey, while Virgil,
the Latin poet, takes up the history of Æneas after the
fall of Troy, and gives account of his many adventures
by land and sea. As our sketch has only to do with his
visit to Carthage and his meeting with Queen Dido
there, we must confine our narration to that part of the
Æneid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>While the battle was still raging in the city of Troy,
and the old King Priam was slain in his palace by the
son of the great Achilles, Æneas, finding the fate of
Troy was sealed, hastened to his own home, and taking
his old father Anchises upon his shoulders, and leading
his little son Ascanius by the hand, followed by his wife
Creüsa, they fled from the city to the temple of Ceres,
where they were to meet others, who should accompany
them upon their wanderings. But as Æneas hastened to
go, Creüsa, his wife, was severed from him. Leaving
Anchises and his son with his comrades who had assembled
at the temple of Ceres, Æneas fled back into the
city, searching for his wife. But nowhere could he find
her, and as he sought her, sorrowing, lo! as he called her
name, her image seemed to stand before him; and thus
her spirit addressed him:—</p>

<p>“Why art thou vainly troubled? The ruler of Olympus
willeth not that Creüsa should bear thee company in
thy journey. Weep not, then, for Creüsa, whom thou
lovest, nor think that I shall be carried away to be a
bond-slave to some Grecian woman. Such fate befits not
a daughter of Dardanus, and daughter-in-law of Venus.
The mighty Mother of the Gods keepeth me in this land
to serve her. And now, farewell, and love the young
Ascanius, even thy son and mine.” So saying, the spirit
vanished from his sight, and Æneas, weeping, returned to
his father and son and his comrades, now gathered at the
temple of Ceres.</p>

<p>Then Æneas and his companions builded themselves
ships, that they might sail over the seas, in obedience to
the command of the gods, that they should seek another
land; and when a year was wellnigh passed, the work
was finished. Whereupon they sailed, taking their gods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
with them. We have not space to recount their experiences
in Thrace, Delos, or Crete; or to tell the story of
the dreadful Cyclopés; nor of the death and burial of old
Anchises in Sicily. But scarcely had they sailed from
the land of Sicily, when Juno beheld them. Most wrathful
was her countenance as she looked down upon these
hated Trojans; and she said to herself: “Shall these men
of Troy always baffle my august will? Shall I, though
wife to mighty Jupiter, avail nothing against these people?
Behold, none shall pay me honor and sacrifice if
mortals thus withstand the wishes of the Goddess of
Olympus.” Thus musing in her heart, she betook herself
to the land of Æolia, where King Æolus holdeth the
winds within the mountains; and though they roar within
the earth with furious mutterings, their king restraineth
them according to his will. To him fair Juno spoke:
“O Æolus, whom great Jupiter maketh king of the
powerful winds, listen to my words. A nation whom I
hold in no favor now saileth over the Tuscan seas.
Loose now thy storms against them, so that their ships
be buried in the deep; and behold, I will reward thee
with the fairest maiden of all those lovely nymphs who
around me wait my bidding.”</p>

<p>Then King Æolus answered:—</p>

<p>“O Queen of dread Olympus! ’tis thine to order what
thou wilt, and mine to obey thine august commands. It
was thy gracious gift which bestowed upon me this
sovereignty, and by thy favor am I permitted a place at
the table of the gods.”</p>

<p>Whereupon he unbarred the doors of the prison of the
winds, which straightway rushed forth together in a
mighty host, and rolled mountain high the waves of the
sea. And thunders muttered, and lightnings flashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
across the heavens. Then were Æneas and his companions
in great fear, and they called upon the gods in
terror. Some of their ships were sunk in the sea, others
shattered by the winds. Then was King Neptune roused
by the wild commotions which waged in his dominions,
and being aware of the wiles of his sister-goddess, he
called to the winds with commanding voice:—</p>

<p>“What is this, ye winds, that ye dare to trouble my
dominions without my august summons? Begone, and
tell your king that the sea is mine to rule, and bid him
confine his power to his allotted rocks and caves.”</p>

<p>Then did King Neptune cross the sea in his chariot;
and the rebellious waves sank back affrighted at the bidding
of their mighty sovereign; and behold, the sea was
calm and placid as the summer’s smile. And the gods of
the sea drew the ships from the rocks, King Neptune lifting
them with his ponderous trident. So Æneas and his
companions, being sore wearied with the storm, made for
the nearest land in haste, and thus they found a haven
in a land, even Africa. Hither came Æneas with seven
ships.</p>

<p>Glad indeed were the men of Troy to stand once more
upon dry land. Meanwhile, Æneas climbed a cliff to
look upon the land whither they had come, and see if
haply he might behold his comrades’ ships, which, though
he saw not, his labor was not in vain, for on the shore he
noted three majestic stags, and, following, a goodly herd.
Then did he let his arrows fly till seven of the animals
were killed, which furnished ample food for the men upon
his seven ships; which event greatly cheered their hearts;
and thereupon they made a feast upon the shore, Æneas
encouraging them with hopeful words of future peace and
happiness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile upon these things great Jupiter looked down.
And as he gazed, fair Venus, mother of Æneas, approached
the mighty Jove with shining eyes bedimmed with tears.
And thus she spoke: “O great Father, Ruler of all things!
Didst thou not promise that my son Æneas and the men
of Troy should rule o’er land and sea? Why art thou,
then, turned back from thy purpose?” To whom Jove
answered, whilst at the same moment he bent his awful
head and kissed her brow, and his stern features calmed
themselves like sunshine breaking through tempestuous
clouds: “Fear not, my daughter! the fate of thy children
changeth not. Thou shalt see this longed-for city which
the Trojan race shall build, and thou shalt receive thy
great-hearted Æneas safe on Mount Olympus.</p>

<p>“Æneas shall subdue the people of Italy, and build a
city there, and shall reign three years; and after thirty
years shall the boy Ascanius, who shall hereafter be called
Iülus, change his throne from Lavinium to Alba, and for
three hundred years shall Hector’s kindred rule therein.
Then shall twin sons be born, whom a she-wolf shall
suckle. The one of whom, even Romulus, shall build a
mighty city in honor of Mars, and it shall be called Rome.
Juno shall then repent her of her wrath, and join with me
in favor of the men of Rome, and they shall bear rule
even over Argos and Mycenæ.”</p>

<p>Having thus spoken, the mighty Jupiter called to his
presence swift Mercury, who, donning winged sandals
and golden helmet, flew shortly to Carthage, and as Jove
commanded, turned the heart of Dido and her people to
receive with favor these Trojan strangers thus cast upon
their shores.</p>

<p>On the next day, Æneas, taking only Achates with
him, went forth to view this new land whither they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
come. And lo! Venus, his mother, met him in the midst
of a thick wood. But the goddess veiled her heavenly
features so that he knew her not, for she appeared habited
as a Spartan maiden, after the fashion of a huntress.</p>

<p>Then first she spoke: “Have ye seen one of my sisters
hereabouts? She is clothed in the skin of a spotted lynx,
and girded with a quiver; or perchance she hunts a wild
boar with horn and hound.” To whom Æneas answered,
wondering at her imperial bearing which her disguise
could not entirely conceal: “O Virgin! for what shall I
indeed call thee; for surely neither thy mien nor voice
betokens mortal woman. Methinks thou art in truth some
goddess,—perchance sister of Phœbus, or haply some
heavenly nymph. I have not seen thy sister; but I pray,
forsooth, that thou wouldst tell us whither we have been
driven, and who are the people amongst whom we find
ourselves.”</p>

<p>And Venus replied: “It is indeed a Tyrian city that
is near by, though the land be Libya. Dido is queen of
this great city, having come hither from Tyre, flying from
a wicked brother who had killed her husband in avaricious
greed.</p>

<p>“This Dido was married to one Sichæus, richest among
all the men of Phœnicia, and greatly beloved by his wife,
whose brother Pygmalion held the throne of Tyre and
thirsted for possession of the vast treasures of his
brother-in-law, the priest of Hercules. And even at the
altar he slew him, but hid the matter from Dido, hoping
to get the coveted gold. But behold, the shade of Sichæus
appeared to faithful Dido, showing his wounds by
which he had been deprived of mortal life, and told
her where he had hidden his treasures in the earth,
bidding her secure them straightway and prepare for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
instant flight from Tyre and Pygmalion’s greed and
cruelties.</p>

<p>“Then did Dido gather together many of the Tyrian
nobles and men of skill, and with them she fled across the
sea, and landed on this coast, where she has reared a
mighty city, even brave Carthage; but from whence art
thou, and whither do ye go?” To whom Æneas answered:
“The long story of our wanderings would require
many hours to relate. But suffice it, we are men of
Troy, driven by storms to this Libyan shore. Men call
me Prince Æneas, and my race is from Jupiter himself.
We seek the land of Italy, for thither the gods have bidden
us repair. With twenty ships did I set sail, but now
scarce seven are left.”</p>

<p>Then Venus said with tender voice and mien of sympathy:
“Surely thou art beloved of the gods, whoever
thou art, brave stranger! Go show thyself to the queen,
even fair Dido; and as for thy ships and thy companions,
fear not. Behold yon flock of twenty snow-white swans
flying through air. See, e’en though an eagle swoops
down from the sky and puts them to confusion for a time,
again they move in order and settle safely on the ground.
If I have not learned augury in vain, thus shall thy ships
come safely in the harbor.”</p>

<p>Then Venus turning, Æneas beheld a rosy light illumine
her neck, and from her hair there came an odor
sweet of heavenly ambrosia, and her garments grew into
goddess-like vestments around her feet, ere she had
vanished from the eyes of mortals. Then Æneas cried
aloud: “O heavenly mother! why dost thou mock me
with vain glimpses of thy much-loved form, nor suffer me
to touch thy hand, nor grant me sight of thine immortal
face?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Then went Æneas and Achates towards the walls of
the city, and Venus covered them with a thick mist, that
thus no man should gaze on them, even though they might
themselves behold all men and objects. And having
mounted a hill o’erlooking the city, they marvelled much
to behold its size and greatness. Some built the walls,
rolling therefor great stones, while others reared the
citadel, or marked the spot for houses. Others digged
harbors or raised the walls of spacious theatres. Now in
the midst of the city was a thickly wooded spot where
Dido was erecting a noble temple in honor of Juno. Of
bronze were gates and door-posts, and stately threshold
with many steps thereunto.</p>

<p>And here Æneas wondered much to see painted upon
the lofty walls the famous story of the fall of Troy. In
order were the battles portrayed, and all the valiant Greeks
and valorous Trojans were also there depicted; and Æneas
knew himself, fighting amongst the Grecian chiefs.</p>

<p>Much was he moved thereat, and said with tears to
Achates, his companion: “Is there any land which the
story of our sorrows has not reached? Surely this fame
shall profit us!” And lo! while Æneas marvelled at
these things, Dido, most beautiful of women, fair as
Diana, appeared amidst a throng of lovely maidens and
bands of comely youths. Right nobly did she bear herself
amongst her subjects, until she sat herself down on
gorgeous throne in the gate of the temple, having armed
heroes around her. There she dispensed justice, and
apportioned to each his task in the building of her grand
and stately city. Then suddenly Æneas beheld a company
of men arrive with haste where Dido held her court,
and quickly he perceived amongst them Antheus, and
Cloanthus, and other men of Troy, from whom he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
been parted by the storm. Then leave being given Ilioneus,
one of them, to address Queen Dido regarding their
presence there, he thus began: “O Queen! whom Jupiter
permits to rear this spacious city, we are men of Troy
whom storms have driven to your midst; we pray thee
spare our ships from flames, and save a people serving
the gods. There is a land called Italy, whither we
journey, as the gods commanded. We had a king,
Æneas, but we know not whether he be alive or buried
in the sea.”</p>

<p>Then Dido answered: “Fear not, ye men of Troy!
Know that I will give you help and protect you. If you
will settle in this land, Trojans and Tyrians shall be equal
in my sight. Would that your king were here! But I
will send messengers throughout this land to seek him,
lest haply he be cast upon the shore.”</p>

<p>Then were Æneas and Achates glad to hear this welcome
of the fair Queen Dido; and they would fain have
shown themselves, but the mist restrained them. But
lo! the cloud parted forthwith, and Æneas stood before
the queen, with face and breast as of a god; for so his
mother had clothed him, and cast about him a purple light,
through which he shone with all the beauties of youth.
Then spake he to Queen Dido:—</p>

<p>“Lo! I am he you ask for, even Æneas of Troy. So
long as the rivers run to the seas, and the shadows fall
on the hollows of the hills, so long shall thy name and
glory last for this thy kindness to poor strangers cast
upon thy shores.”</p>

<p>Then Dido, after a time of silent meditation, graciously
replied: “I too have wandered far, even as you, and having
suffered much, have learnt to succor them that suffer.
Even from the day my father Belus conquered Cyprus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
have I known the wondrous tale of Troy. Come ye,
therefore, to my palace.”</p>

<p>So saying, she led Æneas to her stately palace, sending
meanwhile most bountiful provision to his companions in
the ships,—even twenty oxen, a hundred swine, and a
hundred sheep and lambs. Then in her royal palace a
sumptuous feast was spread. The tables were weighted
with gold and silver vessels and cups of marvellous workmanship,
whereon were engraved great deeds of valor.
The rooms were adorned with luxurious couches draped
with costly purple, embroidered with cunning skill; while
fair Dido was herself most radiant in resplendent robes
of shining tissues sparkling with priceless gems.</p>

<p>Then did Æneas send Achates in haste to the ships,
that he might bring the young Ascanius to the feast.
Also Æneas ordered that the boy should be laden with
rare and costly gifts, of such things as they had saved
from the ruins of Troy, that they might be presented to
fair Dido as a grateful offering for her most courteous
reception of himself and followers.</p>

<p>Among these gifts there was a mantle of golden tissue
and a veil bordered with yellow acanthus: this had fair
Helen brought from her Grecian home, and which her
mother Leda had lovingly bestowed. There was a sceptre
likewise, having belonged to Ilione, eldest daughter of
King Priam; also a necklace of pearls, and a double crown
of gold encrusted with dazzling jewels. But ere the boy
Ascanius departed from the ships bearing these gifts,
Venus contrived a cunning scheme to guard her son
Æneas from any coming treachery from the men of Tyre;
for Venus pondered well on Juno’s hatred of her son and
many wiles. So fair Venus called to her aid her bright
son Cupid, even the lovely wingéd boy known as the god<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
of Love. To him she thus unfolded her well-laid
plan:—</p>

<p>“Most beautiful and powerful Cupid! my best-beloved
son, who laughest at the dreadful thunders of the mighty
Jupiter, and canst even defy the wiles of wrathful Juno,
thy aid I seek in guarding Æneas from her treacherous
devices. To-day Queen Dido entertains thy brother Æneas
in her palace, and showeth him courteous favor; but evil
may betide unless her heart is fixed in continued liking
for him. List thou, and do my bidding! His son Ascanius
even now cometh from the ships, laden with rich gifts
for the Carthaginian queen. I would that thou shouldst
assume his dress and features and mode of speech and
gait; bear thyself these presents to fair Dido, while I,
meanwhile, will snatch the boy Ascanius away in a cloud,
and bear him to Cythera or Idalium, and hide him there
in heavy slumbers, resting on bed of sleep-producing
flowers and fanned with gentle zephyrs. Do thou, meanwhile,
go to the palace as Ascanius, and when Dido welcomes
thee with kiss and fond embrace, breathe into her
heart a fire of love, so that she shall forget the grave of
Sichæus, and turn her thoughts and glances upon the
handsome countenance of Æneas.”</p>

<p>Thus did it come to pass. Ascanius slept in the cool
and shady woods of Idalium, lulled by sweet-smelling
flowers, and Cupid in the guise of Æneas’s son did bear
the costly gifts to the fair queen, which graciously she
received with tender welcome and loving embraces of
the beautiful boy, who, after greeting Æneas as his
father, betook himself to the side of the gentle Dido; and
as she toyed with his shining locks of golden hair or
pressed fond kiss upon his brow, the wily Cupid did forthwith
ensnare her heart; and though he had left wings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
darts behind when he put off his godlike mien, his bright
eyes sent arrows of fire to her heart, and his childish
clasp around her neck did thrill her being. But ’twas of
the brave Æneas that she thought, and petted the pretty
boy for his supposed father’s sake. Much the Tyrians
marvelled at the costly gifts of Prince Æneas, and more
they wondered at his beautiful boy, the false Ascanius;
and Dido could not satisfy her eyes with looking on this
lovely vision of youthful beauty; and little wot she of
the trouble that same winning child was preparing for her
in the days to come.</p>

<p>Most sumptuous was the feast. Then the queen called
for a huge cup of gold, encrusted with gems, from which
King Belus, her illustrious father, often drank in his days
of power; and having filled it with the sparkling wine,
she cried: “Great Jupiter, thou god of feasts and mightiest
of all the immortals at the table of the gods, grant joy
this day to men of Troy and men of Tyre, and may our
friendship endure to future generations.” And having
touched the foaming goblet to her lips, she handed it to
the highest princes of the realm, and each in order drank.
Then did the minstrel Iopas, famed for striking wondrous
music from the harp, give charming entertainment to the
guests, singing of sun and moon and stars; of Arcturus
and Hyades, and why the winter sun hastens to dip his
shining head in ocean, and why the winter nights are
long and dreary; and also of men and beasts he sang;
of valiant deeds and adventures of the chase. Then
Queen Dido asked Æneas much of Troy and the wondrous
story of its direful fall; nor was she satisfied until
he had recounted all things that had befallen him, both
during that famous contest and since, even till he landed
on her shores. And many days were spent in telling this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
most fascinating tale; for still again each day the queen
begged he would renew the marvellous account of heroes
slain or battles won. Much was Queen Dido moved in
spirit by this story, and still with greater favor did she
esteem the teller of this wondrous tale, and scarce could
sleep for thinking of him.</p>

<p>Then thus she spake to her sister Anna: “O my sister,
I have been greatly troubled this night with evil dreams.
Who can be this wondrous stranger who hath come to our
coasts? Surely his noble mien and brave valor betokens
that he is one of the sons of the gods! Were I not steadfastly
purposed that I would not yoke myself again in
marriage, to this man only might I yield.”</p>

<p>Then Anna answered: “Why wilt thou waste thy youth
in useless sorrow for the dead? Think also of the dangers
which surround thy throne, and to what greatness may the
strength of Carthage grow through such alliance. Seek
counsel of the gods, who, methinks, direct thy heart.”</p>

<p>Thus did her sister offer comforting advice, the which,
forsooth, fair Dido was not loath to take.</p>

<p>Then was a royal hunt prepared. The princes of
Carthage waited for their queen at the palace door, where
her proud steed stood champing his golden bit, caparisoned
with royal trappings of gold and purple. Beauteous
indeed was fair Dido, as she appeared adorned with
Sidonian mantle with embroideries of divers colors. Her
quiver was of gold, and of the same the rich clasp of her
mantle, while her hair was caught in knot of gold.
Æneas came to meet her, beautiful as Apollo himself; and
forth the hunters went with goodly escort, and coming to
the hills, found many goats and stags, which they chased;
Ascanius scorning such easy hunting, wishing for wild
boar or lion for his prey.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>Then did a terrible storm arise; and seeking shelter,
the guests were separated from one another, and the
Tyrian princes also lost sight of their queen. By
order of the gods, fair Dido and brave Æneas fled both
to the same sheltering cave. Here was their troth
plighted; and when the nuptial knot was tied by Hymen,
god of marriage, straightway the goddess Rumor reported
this event throughout all Libya, how that fair Dido was
wedded to Æneas of Troy. Then was Iarbas, her former
suitor, very wroth, and vowed swift vengeance, and made
haste to the temple of Jupiter and spread his grief before
the great ruler of Olympus. Whereupon great Jove despatched
swift-footed Mercury to Æneas with this message:—</p>

<p>“Thus saith the king of gods and men: Is this what
thy mother promised of thee, twice saving thee from the
spear of the Greeks? Art thou he that shall rule Italy,
and its mighty men of war, and spread thy dominions to
the end of the world? What doest thou here? Why
lookest thou not to Italy? Depart, and tarry not.”</p>

<p>This message swift Mercury brought to Æneas, where
he stood, with yellow jasper in his sword-hilt, and
wrapped in cloak of purple, gold embroidered—Queen
Dido’s gifts. Having delivered the commands of mighty
Jupiter to the trembling Trojan hero, the god Mercury
vanished, and Æneas was left with troubled thoughts to
ponder on these weighty words. At last he joined his
companions, having resolved to fly from alluring Carthage;
and he bid them secretly prepare their fleet for
sailing. Meanwhile he sought some fitting opportunity
to take a last farewell of the beautiful queen, who by her
loving devotion made his going grievous.</p>

<p>But Dido, with jealous love, which is most keen of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
sight, divined his purpose ere he had revealed it to her;
and quickly seeking Æneas, she exclaimed in mingled
love and anger: “Thoughtest thou to hide thy purpose
and to depart in silence from this land? Carest thou not
for her whom thou leavest to die? And hast thou no fear
of winter storms upon the sea? Repent thee of this cruel
resolve.”</p>

<p>But Æneas, fearing the words of Jupiter, stood with
averted eyes and looks which relented not. At last he
spake:—</p>

<p>“I deny not, O Queen, the benefits thou hast done to
me, nor while I live shall I forget Dido. But the gods
command that I should seek Italy. Thou hast thy Carthage;
why dost thou grudge Italy to us? Nor may I
tarry. Even now the messenger of Jupiter came to me
and bade me depart.”</p>

<p>Then was Queen Dido very wroth; and her eyes blazed
with jealous love and anger, which waged within her heart
a mighty contest. At last she cried: “As for thee, I
keep thee not. Go, seek thy Italy across the seas; only
if there is any vengeance in heaven, thou wilt pay the
penalty for this wrong. Then wilt thou call on Dido in
vain. Ay, and wherever thou shalt go, I will haunt thee,
and rejoice in the dwellings below to hear thy doom.”</p>

<p>Having said which, the afflicted queen hasted to depart
to her palace. But her grief o’ercame her powerful spirit,
so that she fell like to one dead, and was laid by her
maidens upon her bed.</p>

<p>Though Æneas would fain comfort the sorrowing queen,
the word of Jove o’ermastered his inclination, so that he
hasted to his ships and speedily prepared for flight. But
when the spirit returned to fainting Dido, she cried out
in heart, and bade her sister note the treacherous Trojans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
who thus so poorly repaid her generous treatment. And
Dido sought once more to move the mind of Æneas, even
sending Anna to him to beg that if he must depart indeed,
he yet would stay his going for a space of time. But
stern Æneas relented not; whereupon fair Dido grew
weary of her life, and as she offered sacrifice she perceived
many ill omens of coming woe. Then she bethought
herself of a plan to avenge her heart, though it
should cost her life. But she hid the matter from her sister,
and said to her that a noted prophetess had declared
there was a remedy which should bring her Trojan hero
back or free her of him.</p>

<p>Thus she deceived her trusting sister, who little imagined
her direful purpose. And Queen Dido bade her
sister build a funeral pile—for so the priestess had commanded—and
put thereon the sword which Æneas had
left behind; also the garments he wore, and the couch on
which he lay, even all that was his, that they might perish
together. Also an image of Æneas was laid upon the
pile, and the priestess, with hair unbound, sprinkled
thereon water, said to be drawn from the lake of Avernus,
while she scattered evil herbs that had been cut at
the full moon with a sickle of bronze. Dido herself,
meanwhile, with loosened garments and bare feet, threw
meal upon the fire, and called upon the gods for vengeance.
Thus did the queen hide her dread purpose ’neath spell of
witchery and sacrifice to the gods.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Æneas lay asleep in his ship, and in
a dream again Mercury appeared and warned him of Dido,
telling him to fly and tarry not.</p>

<p>Æneas, waking in great fear, called his companions, and
they straightway loosed the sails and sped o’er the sea.</p>

<p>And in the morning, lo! Dido, from her watch-tower,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
perceived the Trojan fleet had fled. Then did she smite
upon her breast, and tore her hair in anguish. But still
she kept her real intent from all around her; and calling
to old Barcé, who had been nurse to Sichæus, she did
dissemble her great grief, and bade her call her sister
Anna, that she might now prepare the sacrifice; and Dido
also bade old Barcé to bind a garland round her head, for
she was now minded to finish the sacrifice, and to burn
the image of the man of Troy. Then when the old
woman hasted to do her bidding, Dido herself ran to the
funeral pile, made for the burning, and drew the sword
of Æneas from the scabbard, and having mounted the
pile, she threw herself upon Æneas’s couch, and wept and
kissed his image, and cried: “Shall I die unavenged?
Nevertheless, let me die. The man of Troy shall see this
fire from the sea, whereon he journeys, and carry with
him an augury of death.”</p>

<p>And when her sister and her maidens, coming in haste,
looked upon the pile, lo! she had fallen upon the sword,
and the blood was upon her hands. Then a great cry
arose throughout the palace, and Anna, rushing through
the midst, called upon her name: “O my sister, was this
thy purpose? Were the pile and the sword and the fire
for this?” Then she climbed upon the pile and took her
sister in her arms and sought to stanch the flowing blood.
Three times did Dido strive to raise her eyes; three times
did her spirit leave her. Then Juno, looking down from
heaven and perceiving that her pain was long, in pity
sent down Iris, her messenger, that she might loose the
soul that struggled to be free. For, seeing that she
died not by nature, nor yet by the hand of man, but before
her time and by her own madness. Queen Proserpine
had not shred the ringlet from her head which she shreds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
from them who die. Wherefore, Iris, flying down with
dewy wings from heaven, with a thousand colors about
her from the light of the sun, stood above her head and
said, “I give thee to death, even as I am bidden, and
loose thee from thy body.” Then she shred the lock, and
Queen Dido yielded up her mortal spirit.</p>

<p>Once more Æneas met Queen Dido when he was permitted
by the gods to descend into the land of shadows,
where dwelt the shades of the dead.</p>

<p>When Æneas and the Sibyl, who conducted him thither,
came to the river Styx, then was the Boatman Charon
persuaded to ferry them over, for the Sibyl showed him
the marvellous bough of gold, a gift intended for the
Queen of Hades; and the huge, terrible watch-dog Cerberus,
which guards the portals to the Land of Shadows,
was tamed by eating of the cake the Sibyl gave, made of
honey and poppy-seed, causing sleep.</p>

<p>Thus did they come within the Mourning Fields, where
dwell the souls of those who have died of love. Among
these shades was Dido, fresh from the wound wherewith
she slew herself. And when Æneas saw her darkly
through the shadows, he wept and cried: “O Dido! it
was truth, then, that they told me,—that thou hadst slain
thyself with the sword? Loath was I, O Queen,—I swear
it,—to leave thy land. But the gods constrained me;
nor did I think that thou wouldst take such sorrow from
my departure. But stay! depart not; for never again
may I speak to thee, but this time only.”</p>

<p>But Dido cast her eyes upon the ground, and her heart
was hard against him, even as a rock. His tears and
groans and sighs and friendly words moved not her spirit,
nor could appease her wrath. Silent and scornful she
departed to the grove that was hard by, where dwelt her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
first husband, Sichæus, who gave her love, even as he
was loved by her.</p>

<p>Thus was the love of Dido, which Æneas had slighted,
avenged. And herewith endeth the poet’s story of the
famous Queen Dido, in which he telleth of her fame and
beauty and unhappy love and direful death.</p>

<h2>CLEOPATRA.<br>

<small>69-30 B.C.</small></h2>

</div>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">THE river shone like burnished silver, resplendent in
the rays of the midday sun, as Osiris drove his shining
chariot of day across high heaven’s arch. The city
lay along its banks in calm repose and beauty. Its palaces
and villas were shaded with palms and groves of
olives and clusters of stately pomegranate-trees, while
flowers and fountains adorned its many stately avenues.</p>

<p>In his costly palace the great Roman Triumvir gave
public audience to some important tribunal of state.</p>

<p>But now, above the noise of city sounds, arose the
strains of distant music. So faint and yet so sweet it
was wafted on the air, that all who heard must needs,
perforce, be led to seek its source, as though directed by
some secret spell which could not be resisted. The
notes seemed floating o’er the river’s shining waves; and
all the people crowded on its banks, with wistful curiosity,
striving to catch the first glimpse of the mysterious cause
of such unwonted melody.</p>

<p>Then flashes, with sudden glory, before their eyes a
wondrous sight, which holds them spellbound in o’erwhelming
admiration. From round a curve in the undulating
bank, glides swiftly before their vision a gorgeous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
barge, the poop of which was beaten gold. The silken
sails were royal purple, embroidered with silver lotus-blossoms;
and as they swelled in the light breeze, a fragrance
floated from their perfumed folds so exquisitely
delicious, that the winds seemed love-sick with their odorous
sweetness. The silver oars, gleaming in the sunshine,
kept stroke with tune of flutes and lyres and cymbals;
and the limpid water, parted by their glistening blades,
followed each stroke with amorous touch and sweet caressing,
as though loath to break away in rainbow-tinted
showers of shining drops.</p>

<p>But how describe the matchless vision of womanly and
goddess-like perfection which entranced the eyes of all
beholders, as the gorgeous barge drew nearer to the city,
moving with stately gliding motion, harmonious with the
ear-enchanting melodies played by seeming sirens, nymphs,
and mermaids, on silver lutes and jewelled flutes and shining
cymbals.</p>

<p>Under a pavilion of cloth of gold and priceless tissues,
upon a couch, gorgeous with costliest draperies, in picturesque
repose, yet studied attitude of queenliest grace and
goddess-like abandon, appeared a form and face most
radiantly fair and bountifully beautiful; though orientally
voluptuous yet exquisitely attractive; seemingly divine,
like some heavenly goddess; and yet, in truth, so like a
human woman, with warm, soft flesh and tender eyes, and
deep, rich heart’s blood thrilling through every vein,
e’en to the end of her fair, tapering finger-tips. This
radiant being was attired as Venus, Goddess of Beauty;
and around her stood young pretty boys, decked out as
Cupids, rosy-tinted, and with soft white wings expanded;
and they gently fanned her glowing cheeks with feathers,
odorous with most intoxicating perfumes; while lovely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
maidens, costumed as mermaids, plied the silver oars in
unison with the notes struck from the lyres of gayly decorated
nymphs; while charming muses and bewitching
graces with rosy lips caressed the silver flutes, or clasped
with jewelled fingers the golden cymbals.</p>

<p>It was indeed a vision of enchantment. Whence came
these radiant beings? Had the great goddess, in truth,
descended from high Olympus, attended by her heavenly
train? or did fair Isis, the queen of Egypt,—worshipped
both as deity and nature,—thus clothe herself with mortal
likeness, and deign to become visible to mortal eyes?</p>

<p>Thus questioned the people, and pondered of the meaning
of this o’erwhelming scene of gorgeous majesty and
irresistible loveliness, according as their beliefs partook
of Grecian mythology or Egyptian lore.</p>

<p>Such was the scene of Cleopatra’s sail in her magnificent
barge, up the river Cydnus to the city of Tarsus.
That we may understand more clearly the life of this
famous queen, we must turn back the pages of Egyptian
history. Nor can we stop there. To clearly define her
origin, the fair land of Greece must also be visited; and
the gorgeous pageants of Rome, at the time of her greatest
glory, have a place in the story of this illustrious
Queen of Egypt, Daughter of Greece, Magic Sorceress of
the Nile.</p>

<p>Would that we could think of the fascinating Cleopatra
only as this vision of perfect loveliness which she presents
in this enchanting scene upon the river Cydnus; but there
are dark and bloody deeds and savage barbarities and revolting
vices, which loom up in the background of this
fair picture, with huge and horrid forms, and make the
telling of Cleopatra’s story, fascinating as it is in some
respects, often an unpleasant recital of vice and crime,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
even though we endeavor to touch these dark shadows
ever so lightly. For as we write of history, not of fiction,
we cannot always avoid these hideous facts.</p>

<p>Why is Cleopatra so fair of skin, though an Egyptian
by birth? Her attendant maidens on this fairy-like barge
stand round her like dusky figures cut from bronze; but
her fair face and limbs gleam with pale ivory-tints, and
the sunshine even glimmers in her dark tresses, now
coiled in the Grecian knot behind her shell-like ears.</p>

<p>Though Egypt was her birthplace, Grecian blood flows
through her veins, and whitens her skin, and lightens the
dusky shadows in her hair, and gives the brown shadings
to her lustrous eyes; and Grecian culture gives her voice
its oft-narrated magic charm of melting sweetness; and a
spark of Grecian genius quickens her powers of mind,
and gives her the enchanting fascination of brilliant wit,
and a native aptitude of acquiring knowledge, and all the
polite arts and sciences; and her Grecian free-born grace
lends to her form its perfect pose of queenly stateliness,
together with an irresistible charm in every easy motion
of rounded limb, and unstudied naturalness of action.
The agile litheness of the Greek is combined with the oriental
voluptuous indolence of the Egyptian; which combination
explains the otherwise unaccountable, weird,
and subtle allurements of face and form which history,
romance, and poetry have acceded to her. Shakespeare
calls her “the serpent of old Nile,” “this great fairy,”
“great Egypt”; and Horace gives to her the name of
“fatal prodigy.” Leigh Hunt describes her as</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 9.5em;">“.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That southern beam,</span></div>
<div class="verse">The laughing queen that caught the world’s great hands.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Another writer says of her: “She was born a princess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
reigned a queen, won an emperor, swayed a hero, and defeated
a conqueror. We think of her as the queen of
enslavers more than as queen of Egypt. Cleopatra is
enthroned enchantress of the world. She, of all her sex,
in her person, gave to the unworthy art of coquetry a
something magnificent and lustrous in its so potent exercise.
Hers was the poetry of coquetry.”</p>

<p>Even the scene of Cleopatra in her gorgeous barge
upon the river Cydnus does not give a complete picture of
this wonderful story. In the background we must paint
the Mediterranean Sea, which she has crossed in her journey
thither; and then beyond looms up the city of Alexandria,
on the further side; and by it flows the marvellous
river Nile, through the fertile valley irrigated yearly by
its overflowing waters; and high in the background, towering
over all else in the picture, stand the majestic pyramids,
like huge sentinels, guarding the unknown secrets
of Egypt’s wondrous history.</p>

<p>Yes, to rightly comprehend the significance of the
life of the famous Cleopatra, a panorama of changing
scenes, covering centuries of time, would be needed. But
we can only take a bird’s-eye view of those old lands of
weird and endless enchantment.</p>

<p>“Cleopatra was by birth an Egyptian; by ancestry and
descent she was a Greek. Thus, while Alexandria and
the delta of the Nile formed the scene of the most important
events and incidents of her history, it was the blood
of Macedon which flowed in her veins. Her character
and action are marked by the genius, the courage, the
originality, and the impulsiveness pertaining to the stock
from which she sprang. The events of her history, on
the other hand, and the peculiar character of her adventures,
her sufferings, and her sins, were determined by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
circumstances by which she was surrounded, and the influences
which were brought to bear upon her, in the soft and
voluptuous clime where the scenes of her early life were
laid.”</p>

<p>Let us look for one moment at Egypt as a country,
and then take a passing glance at the peculiar characteristics
and customs of that ancient people.</p>

<p>Egypt is situated in the midst of the most extensive
and remarkable rainless district in the world. The Red
Sea divides this tract, and the eastern portion forms the
Arabian desert, while the western African tract has received
the name of Sahara. Through the African desert
flows the Nile; rising in the region of the Mountains of
the Moon, and flowing northward, it empties into the
Mediterranean Sea. These mountains, being near the
equator, are subject to vast and continued torrents of
rain in certain seasons of the year. The river created
by these streams is the Nile, which at times expands over
the entire valley, forming an immense lake, five to ten
miles wide and a thousand miles long. The rains in the
mountains gradually cease, but it requires months for the
water to subside and leave the valley dry. As soon as
the water disappears, a rank and luxurious vegetation
springs up from the entire surface of the earth which has
been submerged. This most extraordinary valley seems
specially preserved by nature for man. The yearly inundation
prevents impassable forests, and also the presence
of wild beasts. Egypt being thus wholly shut in by deserts
on every side, by land, and shoals, and sandbars,
making the approach difficult by sea, remained for many
ages under the rule of its ancient kings. The people
were peaceful and industrious, and its scholars were
famed throughout the world for their learning, science,
and philosophy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>It was during this period of isolation that the famous
pyramids were built, and the huge monoliths were carved,
and the silent Sphinx was reared, and those vast temples
constructed whose ruined columns are now the wonder of
mankind.</p>

<p>As Egypt was always fertile, when famine existed elsewhere,
corn would be plentiful there. Thus neighboring
tribes from Arabia, Palestine, and Syria, when driven by
want and starvation, crossed the barren deserts on the
eastern side, and found this fertile and marvellous country,
already old in learning and the arts, and a certain
kind of civilization far superior to their neighbors.</p>

<p>At length the Persian monarchs conquered the country.
About two hundred and seventy years before the time of
Cleopatra, Alexander the Great, in his wars with Darius,
had taken possession of Egypt; and at his death, in the
division of his empire amongst his generals, Egypt fell to
the share of one of them named Ptolemy. This was the
commencement of the dynasty of the Ptolemies, who were
Greek princes, reigning over this Egyptian empire, formerly
governed by a long line of native kings, reaching
back in history to the year 3000 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span>, and including the
famous lines of Cheops, Thotmosis, Rameses, and others,
known under the general name of the Pharaohs.</p>

<p>We cannot give any particulars of these reigns in this
sketch, and will only mention some of the customs of the
ancient Egyptians previous to the time of Cleopatra.</p>

<p>Egypt contained about five millions of people, who were
divided into various castes. Plato tells us that in Egypt
not only were the priests, the soldiers, and artisans habitually
separated, but that every particular trade and manufacture
was carried on by its own craftsmen, who handed
down the trade from father to son.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The entire cultivated land of Egypt was about twelve
millions of acres. The clothing of the Egyptians consisted
mostly of linen, made from the flax which grew
abundantly in the delta of the Nile. Wool was but little
employed, as the soil was not fitted for grazing sheep.
Cotton was first mentioned in the reign of Amasis, about
566 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> It was also this Amasis who allowed his wife,
the Egyptian queen, to receive the large income from the
royal fishery at the flood-gates to the lake of Moeris, to
meet the expenses of her toilet; and a century later the
reigning monarch added the taxes of the city of Anthylla
to the former income to keep his queen in sandal-strings;
the sum obtained from the fisheries being a talent a day,
or upwards of 70,700 pounds a year: and when this formed
only a portion of the pin-money of the Egyptian queens,
to whom the revenues of the city of Anthylla, famous for
its wines, were also given, it will be seen that the Egyptian
kings were at least very generous to their wives in
this respect, even though they were not very particular
about cutting off their heads or giving them a cup of
poison if they failed to please their royal lords.</p>

<p>Although wool and cotton were sometimes employed as
articles of clothing, the preference was given to linen.
Herodotus mentions some Egyptian dresses of linen, bordered
with a fringe, over which was worn a cloak of white
wool, similar to the <i>bornouse</i> worn at the present day in
Egypt and Barbary.</p>

<p>The dresses of the priests and persons of rank consisted
of an under-garment in the form of an apron, and
a loose upper-robe with full sleeves, secured by a girdle
around the waist; or of an apron, and a shirt with short,
tight sleeves, over which was thrown a loose robe, leaving
the right arm exposed. Princes wore a dress very like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
that of the priests; but their distinguishing mark was a
peculiar badge, at the side of the head, descending to the
shoulder, and frequently adorned with golden fringe.</p>

<p>This ornament contained the lock of hair indicative of
youth; for though the Egyptians shaved their heads and
wore wigs, certain locks of hair were left upon the heads
of children.</p>

<p>Therefore this badge was always attached to the head-dress
worn by princes as an emblem of their rank, as they
were not supposed to have arrived at <i>kinghood</i> during the
life of their father, on the same principle that a Spanish
prince is styled an <i>infant</i>.</p>

<p>The robes of a sovereign varied according to his present
occupation. As all the kings were also priests, when
they were engaged in the office of high-priest their garments
resembled those worn by the sacerdotal order, with
the exception of the apron and head-dress, which were of
peculiar form, and belonged exclusively to the rank of king.
This apron was richly ornamented in front with lions’
heads and other devices, and bordered with rows of asps,
which were the emblems of royalty. After the union of
Lower and Upper Egypt the sovereign wore a double
crown. Egyptian men always shaved the entire head, and
wore wigs, both within the house and out of doors. The
women, however, wore their own hair, and were not shaved
even in times of mourning or after death. Ladies wore
their hair long and plaited in a great number of braids.
The hair was plaited in the triple plait, the ends being left
loose. Around the head was bound an ornamental fillet,
with a lotus-bud falling over the forehead. The ear-rings
worn by Egyptian ladies were large, round, single hoops
of gold, sometimes over two inches in diameter, or made
of six rings soldered together. Often an asp, whose body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
was of gold set with precious stones, was worn by persons
of rank. Some few were of silver. Women wore many
rings, sometimes three and four upon the same finger, and
even the thumb was decorated with a single ring. Rings
were ornamented with the scarabæus, or sacred beetle, or
an engraved stone. They were occasionally in the form
of a knot, or snail, or snake. Two cats, with an emblem
of the goddess Athor between them, seems to have been
a favorite device for rings. Egyptians also wore large
gold anklets, or bangles, armlets, and bracelets, frequently
inlaid with precious stones. Richly ornamented
necklaces were a principal part of the dress of both men
and women.</p>

<p>Great attention was paid by ladies and men of rank to
the beauty of their sandals, which were sometimes richly
ornamented. Shoes were also common in Egypt, many
of them having been found at Thebes. But they are supposed
to have been of late date, and belonged to the
Greeks. The dresses of the women consisted of a loose
robe or shirt, reaching to the ankles, fastened round the
neck with a string, over which they wore a petticoat,
secured at the waist by a girdle. This petticoat or gown,
among ladies of rank, was made of richly colored stuff in
a great variety of patterns. The most elegant of these
figured materials were reserved for the robes of the deities
and queens. Slaves and servants were not allowed to
wear the same costumes as ladies, and their mode of
dressing the hair was also different.</p>

<p>Egyptian ladies seem to have been given to the little
tricks and arts of the toilet as well as more modern
beauties. Of the various articles of the toilet found among
the ancient remains, the principal are bottles, or vases,
for holding ointment, and the <i>kohl</i>, or paint for the eyes;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
also mirrors, combs, and small boxes, spoons, and saucers.
The custom of anointing the body is usual in hot climates,
and contributes greatly to comfort. Their chief care was
bestowed upon the anointing of the hair. The Egyptian
combs were usually of wood, and double, and frequently
carved and ornamented. The custom of staining the eyelids
and brows with a moistened powder of a black color
was of the most ancient date. It was thought to increase
the beauty of the appearance of the eye, by making it
seem larger by this external black ring around it. Many
of these <i>kohl</i>-bottles have been found in the tombs,
together with the bodkin employed in applying the black
cosmetic.</p>

<p>Some of these bottles are ornamented with the figure of
an ape, or monster, supposed to assist in holding the
bottle between his arms while the fair beauty dipped her
dainty bodkin into the much-prized beautifier. Pins and
needles have also been found among the articles of the
toilet. Some of these pins are of gold, and similar in size
to those now employed by ladies as hat-pins and fancy
hair-pins. Metal mirrors are also found richly ornamented
and highly polished. It will be remembered that
the brazen laver made by Moses for the tabernacle was
formed of the “looking-glasses of the women,” who
doubtless brought them from Egypt at the time of the
exodus of the Israelites. The Egyptian dandies were also
not without the highly prized canes. Many of these have
been found at Thebes; some having a carved lotus-blossom
for the head. It was customary, on entering a house,
to leave their canes or sticks in the hall or at the door;
and poor men were often employed to hold the canes of
guests during a party, by the master of the house, who
rewarded them with money or food. We have little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
knowledge of the nature of their baths; but as they were
forbidden in deep mourning to indulge in them, they were
probably considered a luxury as well as a necessity. The
priests were remarkable for their love of cleanliness, shaving
the whole body every three days, and bathing twice
every day and twice during the night. So great an abhorrence
did an Egyptian feel for an unshaven person, that
Herodotus says, “No Egyptian of either sex would on
any account kiss the lips of a Greek, make use of his
knife, his spit and cauldron, or taste the meat of an animal
which had been slaughtered by his hand.”</p>

<p>This shaving of the head among the Egyptians is given
as a reason by Herodotus for the remarkable hardness of
the Egyptian sculls, as compared with those of other people.
The most singular custom of the Egyptians was
that of tying a false beard upon the chin, which was
plaited and shaped according to the rank of the person.
The beards on the figures of the gods were distinguished
by the turning up of the ends. No man ventured to
assume the beard of a deity. But after death, kings
were accorded the honor of having their statues thus distinguished.</p>

<p>The art of painting common boards to imitate costly
varieties, now so often employed, was practised by the
ancient Egyptians. Boxes, chairs, tables, sofas, and
other pieces of furniture were frequently made of ebony
inlaid with ivory, and articles of sycamore and acacia
were ornamented with rare woods.</p>

<p>The Egyptians displayed much taste in their gold,
silver, porcelain, and glass vases. Glass was known
from the earliest times, and glass-blowing was employed
by them twenty-five hundred years ago. It is also stated
that their dead were sometimes enclosed in glass coffins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
or a crystal sarcophagus was made by covering the granite
with a coating of vitrified matter, usually of a deep green
color, which by its transparency allowed the hieroglyphics
engraved upon the stone beneath to be plainly visible.</p>

<p>Emeralds, rubies, amethysts, and other expensive gems
were most successfully imitated by the jewellers of Thebes.
Pliny states that glass-cutting was known to the ancients,
and that the diamond was employed for that purpose, as
at present, even if they were ignorant of the art of cutting
the diamond itself with its own dust. “Diamonds,” says
Pliny, “are eagerly sought by lapidaries who set them in
iron handles, for they have the power of penetrating anything,
however hard it may be.”</p>

<p>The art of embroidery was commonly practised in
Egypt, and gold and silver threads were used for this
purpose. The loom was also employed by them, both in
weaving linen, cotton, and wool, and also for the production
of very rich stuffs, in which various colors were
worked in innumerable patterns by the loom.</p>

<p>The Egyptians were also famed for their manufacture
of paper, which was in the form of parchments made from
the plant papyrus, which grew in the marshy regions of
the Nile in great profusion. Leather was also prepared
by them with great skill for various purposes, and the
knife employed by them in the process, between three
and four thousand years ago, is precisely similar to that
used by modern curriers. Fullers, potters, carpenters,
and cabinet-makers formed a large class of Egyptian
workmen. The Egyptians were skilled in the working of
metals; and gold, silver, brass, tin, iron, and lead were
known in those days.</p>

<p>The art of embalming the dead was practised by the
Egyptians with a perfection never since equalled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Egyptian paintings were very primitive, and their sculptures
were more remarkable for huge grotesqueness than
any perfection of art, as their artists were limited to such
a conventional mode of drawing. After the accession of
the Ptolemies, Greek art became well known in Egypt,
but their artists still continued to adhere to the Egyptian
models prescribed.</p>

<p>The Egyptians appear to have possessed some secret
for hardening or tempering bronze, with which we are
totally ignorant; for the wonderful skill with which they
engraved their granite obelisks with hieroglyphics, for
which purpose they used implements of bronze, cannot be
equalled by any process in modern times.</p>

<p>The walls and ceilings of the houses of the Egyptians
of high rank were richly painted, as well as their tombs.
The ceilings were laid out in compartments, each having
peculiar pattern and border. The favorite forms were
the lotus, the square, the diamond, and the succession of
scrolls.</p>

<p>The mode of laying out the house and grounds varied
according to the means of the owner. Some villas were
of considerable extent, with large gardens surrounding
them. Some of the large mansions were ornamented with
obelisks, like the temples. About the centre of the outer
wall was the main entrance leading to an open walk
shaded by rows of trees. Here were large tanks of water,
and between them a wide avenue led to the centre of the
mansion. Their gardens were well tended, particularly
their vineyards.</p>

<p>Monkeys were trained to assist in gathering the fruit of
the sycamore and other trees.</p>

<p>Many animals were tamed in Egypt for various purposes,
as the lion, leopard, gazelle, baboon, crocodile,
and others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>Among the fruit-trees cultivated by the Egyptians
were the palm, date, dôm-nut tree, sycamore, fig, pomegranate,
olive, peach, almond, persea, locust tree, and
others. The Egyptians were exceedingly fond of flowers,
and they were profusely employed on all festive occasions.
The lotus was the favorite flower, and was more often
preferred for house decoration and personal adornment.
Among other flowers cultivated by them were the chrysanthemum,
acinon, acacia, anemone, convolvulus, olive,
amaricus, and others.</p>

<p>The deity whom they believed presided over the garden,
was Khem, corresponding to the Grecian Pan. Ranno, a
goddess sometimes represented in the form of an asp, or
with a human body and the head of a serpent, was considered
the protecting genius of a vineyard, and also of a
young prince.</p>

<p>This goddess Ranno, or the sacred asp, appears in
many remarkable connections with royalty, and the name
Uræus, which was applied to that snake, has been derived
by Champollion, from <i>ouro</i>, the Coptic word signifying
“king,” as its appellation of basilisk originated in the
<i>basiliscos</i> of the Greeks.</p>

<p>Ancient Egypt was a religious community in which the
palace was a temple, the people worshippers at the gate,
and the monarch the chief priest. “The equal treatment
which the women received in Egypt was shown in other
circumstances beside their being allowed to sit on the
throne. In their mythology, the goddess Isis held rank
above her husband. We see also on the mummy-cases
that the priestly and noble families traced their pedigree
as often through the female line as through the male, and
records were sometimes dated by the names of priestesses.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The Egyptians worshipped many gods. Among them
were <i>Ra</i>, the “sun-god,” sailing in a golden boat across
the heavens; <i>Shu</i>, meaning “air”; <i>Tafnut</i>, the “dew”;
<i>Seb</i>, the “earth”; and <i>Nut</i>, the “heaven.” <i>Osiris</i> was
the “sun,” and <i>Isis</i>, his wife and sister, the “dawn”;
<i>Horus</i>, the “rising sun”; <i>Set</i>, the destroyer of Osiris,
was the “darkness”; and the resurrection of Osiris was
the rising of the sun after the darkness of the night had
been overcome and dispelled. <i>Nepthys</i> was the “sunset”;
<i>Anubis</i>, the “twilight” or “dusk.” <i>Neith</i> corresponded
to the Greek Athêné, and was supposed to be a personification
of the wisdom or intellect of God,—which is a
significant thought, Neith being a <i>goddess</i>, not a god.
She was the Egyptian goddess of Saïs. Originally the
worship of Ammon was distinct from that of Ra, god of
the sun; but after the eighteenth dynasty a union took
place, and he was worshipped as Ammon-Ra. Thoth, the
god of letters, had various characters, according to the
functions he was supposed to fulfil. In one of his characters
he corresponded to the moon; in the other, to Mercury.
“In the former, he was the beneficent property of
that luminary, the regulator and dispenser of time, who
presided over the fate of man and the events of his life;
in the latter, the god of letters and the patron of learning
and the means of communication between the gods and
mankind.”</p>

<p>The Egyptians related many allegories concerning their
various deities, but we have space only to narrate the
story regarding Osiris and Isis, god of the sun and the
goddess of dawn. As their gods were supposed to assume
many different characters and attributes, this story represents
Osiris as the river Nile, Isis as the land of Egypt,
and Typho as the sea.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The allegory is thus given:—</p>

<p>“Osiris, having become king of Egypt, applied himself
towards civilizing his countrymen by turning them from
their former barbarous course of life, teaching them, moreover,
to cultivate and improve the fruits of the earth.
With the same good disposition he afterwards travelled
over the rest of the world, inducing the people everywhere
to submit to his discipline, by the mildest persuasion.
During his absence from his kingdom, Typho had no
opportunity of making any innovations in the state, Isis
being extremely vigilant in the government and always
on her guard. After the return of Osiris, however,
Typho, having persuaded seventy-two other persons to
join him in the conspiracy, together with a certain queen
of Æthiopia, named Aso, who chanced to be in Egypt at
the time, contrived a proper stratagem to execute his
base designs. For, having privately taken a measure of
Osiris’s body, he caused a chest to be made exactly of
that size, as beautiful as possible, and set off with all the
ornaments of art. This chest he brought into the banqueting-room,
where, after it had been much admired by
all present, Typho, as if in jest, promised to give it to
any one of them whose body upon trial it might be found
to fit. Upon this the whole company, one after the other,
got into it; but as it did not fit any of them, last of all
Osiris laid himself down in it, upon which the conspirators
immediately ran together, clapped on the cover, and then,
fastening it on the outside with nails, poured melted lead
over it.</p>

<p>“After this, having carried it away to the riverside, they
conveyed it to the sea by the Tanaïtic mouth of the Nile,
which for this reason is still held in the utmost abhorrence
by the Egyptians, and never named by them but with
proper marks of detestation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>“These things happened on the 17th day of the month
Athor, when the sun was in Scorpio, in the 28th year of
Osiris’s reign, though others say he was no more than
twenty-eight years old at the time.</p>

<p>“The first who knew the accident that had befallen
their king were the Pans and Satyrs, who lived about
Chemmis; and they, immediately acquainting the people
with the news, gave the first occasion to the name of
<i>Panic terrors</i>.... Isis, as soon as the report reached
her, cut off one of the locks of her hair and put on mourning.</p>

<p>“At length she received more particular news of the
chest. It had been carried by the waves of the sea to
the coast of Byblos, and there gently lodged in the branches
of a tamarisk bush, which in a short time had shot up into
a large tree, growing round the chest and enclosing it on
every side, so that it could not be seen; and the king of
the country, having cut down the tree, had made the part
of the trunk wherein the chest was concealed a pillar to
support the roof of his house. Isis, having gone to
Byblos, obtained possession of this pillar, and then set
sail with the chest for Egypt. But intending a visit to
her son Horus, who was brought up at Butus, she deposited
the chest in the meantime in a remote and unfrequented
place. Typho, however, as he was one night hunting by
the light of the moon, accidentally met with it; and knowing
the body enclosed in it, tore it into fourteen pieces,
disposing them up and down in different parts of the
country.</p>

<p>“Being acquainted with this event, Isis set out once
more in search of the scattered members of her husband’s
body, using a boat made of the papyrus rush in order the
more easily to pass through the lower and fenny parts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the country. And one reason assigned for the many different
sepulchres of Osiris shown in Egypt is, that wherever
any one of his scattered limbs was discovered, she
buried it in that spot; though others suppose that it was
owing to an artifice of the queen, who presented each of
those cities with an image of her husband, in order that,
if Typho should overcome Horus in the approaching conquest,
he might be unable to find the real sepulchre. Isis
succeeded in recovering all the different members, with
the exception of one, which had been devoured by the
lepidotus, the phagrus, and the oxyrhinchus; for which
reason these fish are held in abhorrence by the Egyptians.
To make amends, therefore, for this loss, she consecrated
the phallus, and instituted a solemn festival to its memory.</p>

<p>“A battle at length took place between Horus and
Typho, in which the latter was taken prisoner. Isis,
however, to whose custody he was committed, so far
from putting him to death, set him at liberty; which so
incensed Horus that he tore off the royal diadem she
wore; but Hermes substituted in its stead a helmet made
in the shape of an ox’s head. At length two other battles
were fought, in which Typho was defeated.”</p>

<p>This allegory is thus explained:—</p>

<p>“Osiris means the inundation of the Nile.</p>

<p>“Isis, the irrigated portion of the land of Egypt.</p>

<p>“Horus, their offspring, the vapors and exhalations
reproducing rain.</p>

<p>“Butus, the marshy lands of Lower Egypt, where
those vapors were nourished.</p>

<p>“Typho, the sea which swallowed up the Nile water.</p>

<p>“The conspirators, the drought overcoming the moisture,
from which the increase of the Nile proceeds.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“The chest in which Osiris’s body was confined, the
banks of the river, within which it retired after the inundation.</p>

<p>“The Tanaïtic mouth, the lake and barren lands about
it, which were held in abhorrence from their being overflowed
by the river without producing any benefit to the
country.</p>

<p>“The twenty-eight years of his life, the twenty-eight
cubits to which the Nile rises at Elephantina, its greatest
height.</p>

<p>“The 17th of Athor, the period when the river retires
within its banks.</p>

<p>“The queen of Æthiopia, the southern winds preventing
the clouds being carried southward.</p>

<p>“The different members of Osiris’s body, the main
channels and canals by which the inundation passed into
the interior of the country, where each was said to be
afterwards buried. That one which could not be recovered
was the generative power of the Nile, which still
continued in the stream itself.</p>

<p>“The victory of Horus, the power possessed by the
clouds in causing the successive inundations of the Nile.”</p>

<p>Many animals, insects, and plants were considered
sacred by the Egyptians: among them were the cynocephalus
ape, sacred to Thoth; shrew-mouse, sacred to
Mant; dog, sacred to Anubis; cat, sacred to Pashtor
Bubastis; lion, sacred to Gom, or Hercules; hippopotamus,
sacred to Mars; pig and ass, emblems of Typho;
goat, sacred to Mendes; cow, sacred to Athor.</p>

<p>The sacred oxen were Apis, Mnevis, and Basis, sacred
to Osiris, Apollo, and Onuphis.</p>

<p>The sacred birds of Egypt were the vulture, eagle,
hawk, white and saffron-colored cocks, little egret, sacred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to Osiris; ibis, sacred to Thoth; goose, emblem of Seb.
Fabulous and unknown sacred birds were the phœnix,
sacred to Osiris; the “pure soul” of the king (a bird
with man’s head and arms), emblem of the soul; vulture
with a snake’s head; hawk with man’s and ram’s head.</p>

<p>The sacred reptiles were the tortoise, crocodile, asp, and
frog. The fabulous serpents were snakes with human
heads, with hawk’s head, and with lion’s head.</p>

<p>The sacred fishes of Egypt were the oxyrhinchus, the
eel, the lepidotus, satus, and mæotes. The scorpion was
the emblem of the goddess Selk. Different species of
beetles were held sacred to the sun, and adopted as an
emblem of the world.</p>

<p>Foremost amongst the sacred plants of the East, being
not merely a symbol, but frequently the object of worship
in itself, was the undying lotus, which, from the throne
of Osiris, Isis, and Nepthys, rises in the midst of the
waters, bearing on the margin of its blossom the four
genii.</p>

<p>“The Persians represent the sun as ‘rob’d with light,
with lotus crown’d.’ Among the Chinese it symbolized
Buddha, and is the emblem of female beauty. The Japanese
deem it the emblem of purity, since it is not sullied
by the muddy waters in which it often grows. With the
flowers of the motherwort, it is borne before the body in
their funeral processions. The Hindoo deities are often
represented seated upon a lotus flower. Kamadeva, or
Cupid, is depicted as floating down the blue Ganges—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">‘Upon a rosy lotus wreath,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Catching new lustre from the tide</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That with his image shone beneath.’”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The consort of Vishnu, Laksmi, was also called the
“Lotus-born,” because she was said to have ascended
from the ocean on its blossom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Brahma was believed to have sprung from Narayana,—that
is, “the Spirit of God moving on the waters,”—and
he is thus described in a Hindoo poem:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“A form cerulean fluttered o’er the deep;</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Brightest of beings, greatest of the great,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Who, not as mortals steep</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Their eyes in dewy sleep,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But heavenly pensive on the lotus lay,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That blossom’d at his touch, and shed a golden ray.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>An ancient prayer, common to the inhabitants of Tibet
and the slopes of the Himalayas, consists of unceasing
repetitions of the words, <i>Om mane padne haun</i>, meaning,
“Oh, the jewel in the lotus! Amen.”</p>

<p>“The Grecian god of silence, Harpocrates, who was the
Egyptian Aurora, or Dayspring, and was the son of
Isis, was often represented on the lotus. The god Nofre
Atmoo also bore the lotus on his head.”</p>

<p>The lotus is regarded in Egyptian delineations as signifying
the creation of the world. In the gallery of Egyptian
antiquities in the British Museum there are several
statues bearing sceptres formed of the lotus; and also a
mummy holding in each hand of his crossed arms a lotus
flower. There was also brought to England, some years
ago, a bust of Isis emerging from a lotus flower, which
has frequently been mistaken for one of Clytie changing
into a sunflower.</p>

<p>Three species of nymphæceæ, called lotus, were cultivated
in Egypt. One of these still grows in immense
quantities in Lower Egypt. This lotus has fragrant white
blossoms, and fruit the size of that of the poppy, filled
with small seeds, used as an article of food. It closely
resembles our white water-lily. “It was the ‘rose of
ancient Egypt,’ the favorite flower of the country, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
was made into wreaths and garlands. With the blue lotus
of the Nile (<i>Nymphæa cœrulea</i>), it formed models for
many works of art. But the sacred lotus is the Nelumbo.
This is the sacred bean of Egypt, the ‘rose lily of the
Nile’ of Herodotus, the lotus <i>par excellence</i>. Its blossoms
are larger than those of the white or blue lotus; they
are of a brilliant red color sometimes, but rarely white,
and hang over broad peltated leaves, resembling, in their
magnificent beauty, those—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 4em;">‘Eastern flowers large,</span></div>
<div class="verse">Some dropping low their crimson bells</div>
<div class="verse">Half closed; others studded wide</div>
<div class="verse">With disks and tears, that fed the time</div>
<div class="verse">With odor, in the prime of good</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 4.5em;">Haroun Alraschid.’</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“The Nelumbo was cultivated as much for its usefulness
as an article of food, as for its beauty. Its roots,
seeds, and leaf-stalks are all edible. The fruit is formed
of many valves, each containing a nut about the size of a
filbert, with a taste more delicate than that of almonds.
The use of the seeds in making bread, and the mode of
sowing them,—by enclosing each seed in a ball of clay,
and throwing it into the water,—may probably be alluded
to in the text, ‘Cast thy bread upon the waters, for thou
shalt find it after many days.’ The Nelumbo is a native
of the north of Africa, of India, China, Japan, Persia,
and Asiatic Russia, and in all these countries maintains
its sacred character. The fable of the nymph Lotis, who
was transformed into a tree bearing her name, is supposed
to be of Eastern origin. It was under the lote-tree, beyond
which there is no passing, that Mohammed was said
to have met the angel Gabriel. This lotis or lotus tree
must not be confounded with the sacred bean, or lotus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
flower, which is a totally distinct plant. The lotus-tree is
a moderate-sized thorny tree, with broad leaves, fruit as
large as an olive, of a reddish color, containing the nut,
the taste of which is sweetish, resembling that of a fig or
date. It was this lotus-tree which Homer refers to, when
he describes the charm of certain fruit which Ulysses
dreaded would lure his companions to give up home and
friends forever, as the fable was, that whosoever ate of its
fruit would never leave the enchanted land.”</p>

<p>On account of these numerous stories connected with
the far-famed lotus of the East, it has become one of the
most illustrious flowers of romance and poetry. Its praises
have been sung in all the languages of Eastern climes,
until its very name has become the synonyme for oriental
splendor and goddess-like attractions.</p>

<p>The asp appeared to be one of the favorite emblems of
deity, and also of royalty, and many strange stories are
told of different species of asps. The following is related
to show the extreme veneration paid to sacred animals.</p>

<p>“A sacred serpent of Melite had priests and ministers,
a table, and a bowl. It was kept in a tower, and fed by
the priests with cakes made of flour and of honey, which
they placed there in the bowl. Having done this, they
retired. The next day, on returning to the apartment,
the food was found to be eaten, and the same quantity
was again put into the bowl, for it was not lawful for any
one to see the sacred reptile. On one occasion, one of
the priests being anxious to behold it, went in alone, and
having deposited the cake, withdrew, until the moment
when he supposed the serpent had come forth to its repast.
He then entered, throwing open the door with great violence,
upon which the serpent withdrew in evident indignation,
and the priest shortly after became frantic, and
having confessed his crime, expired.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>The Egyptian asp is a species of cobra de capello, and
is still very common in Egypt. As our story of Cleopatra
is connected with the asp, the following facts will be interesting.
It is called Nashir, a word signifying “spreading,”
from its dilating its breast when angry. The snake-players
of modern days use this same serpent in their
juggling tricks, taking care first to extract its fangs, or to
burn out the poison-bag with a hot iron. The asp is generally
about three or four feet long; they are easily
tamed; their food consists of mice, frogs, and other
reptiles. They are accustomed to live in gardens during
the warm weather, where they are of great use. It is
supposed that the asp employed by Cleopatra was a kind
of poisonous snake much smaller than the common
variety; and the name, like that of viper, may have been
applied to venomous serpents of different species. Mummies
of the asp have been discovered in Thebes.</p>

<p>We have not space to describe the marvellous monuments
and pyramids of ancient Egypt, and will only give
one statement of Herodotus in connection with them.
Herodotus says, that each of the two great pyramids near
Memphis required twenty years in building; and that one
hundred thousand men were unceasingly employed on the
work, who were relieved every three months; and that only
sixteen hundred talents of silver were spent on the radishes,
onions, and garlic for the workmen, which was probably
their only pay, making about eighteen pence a year of
our money, for each man.</p>

<p>A slight sketch of an Egyptian house and dinner party
will aid us in obtaining a more definite idea of the manners
and customs of those times. The apartments appropriated
to the reception of guests in Egyptian houses were
sometimes on the ground floor, sometimes in the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
story; though from the size, beauty, and arrangement of
their gardens it is supposed that they often entertained
their friends in the cool and shady retreats there. These
reception rooms were provided with handsome chairs,
fauteuils, stools, and low seats. While conversing, they
did not recline on divans or couches, though ottomans and
richly covered couches formed part of the furniture in
Egyptian apartments of state. Egyptian tables were
round, square, or oblong; the common people sat cross-legged
or crouched on the ground. Little is known of the
furniture of their bedrooms, but numerous wooden pillows
have been found with grooved places for the head. Those
for the rich were made of alabaster. In their entertainments
they made lavish display and provided various
amusements. Songs, music, dancing, buffoonery, feats
of agility, and games of chance were introduced. The
guests arrived in chariots or in palanquins borne by
their servants on foot. Sometimes their attendants held
over them parasols to protect them from the sun, and one
slave carried a stool to enable his master to alight with
ease, while another bore his writing-tablet, or whatever
article of apparel he might need. To those who arrived
from a journey, water was brought in a golden ewer to
wash their feet before entering the reception-room. It
was also customary for each guest to be anointed with
ointment by a servant, as he seated himself; then a lotus
flower was presented to each visitor, who held it in his
hand during the entertainment. Servants also brought
necklaces of the same or other flowers, and hung them
around the neck of each person, and placed garlands of
flowers on their heads with a single lotus bud so arranged
that it would fall over the forehead. Wreaths and other
devices of flowers were laid around the room on stands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
while servants constantly brought fresh blossoms from the
gardens to replace those which had faded. After the
floral decorations, wine was offered to the guests. While
the dinner was being prepared, the company were entertained
by music by a band of musicians, who performed
upon the harp, lyre, guitar, tambourine, double and single
pipe, flute, and other instruments. The Egyptians paid
great attention to the study of music. The father of
Cleopatra received the name of Auletes from his skill in
playing on the flute. Long before the lyre was known
in Greece the Egyptians had attained great perfection
in the form of their stringed instruments, and Greek
sages visited Egypt to study music among the other
sciences for which it was renowned. Harps of fourteen,
and lyres of seventeen, strings are found to have been
used by ordinary Egyptian musicians 1570 <span class="smcap">B.C.</span> The
strings of the Egyptian harp were of catgut, and some
discovered at Thebes in 1823 were so well preserved
that they emitted a sound on being touched. Apollodorus
relates the following story of the supposed invention of
the lyre:—</p>

<p>“The Nile having overflowed the whole country of
Egypt, when it returned within its natural bounds, left on
the shore a great number of animals of various kinds,
and among the rest a tortoise, the flesh of which being
dried and wasted by the sun, nothing remained within the
shell but nerves and cartilages, and these being braced
and contracted by the drying heat became sonorous. Mercury,
walking along the banks of the river, happened to
strike his foot against this shell, and was so pleased with
the sound produced that the idea of a lyre presented itself
to his imagination. He therefore constructed the instrument
in the form of a tortoise and strung it with the dried
sinews of dead animals.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>It was not customary for the upper classes of the Egyptians
to indulge in dancing, and hired dancers were employed
on all festive occasions. Grace in posture and
movement was the chief object of those skilled in the
dance. Many of their postures and steps resembled those
of the modern ballet; and the <i>pirouette</i> enlivened an
Egyptian party more than thirty-five hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Having given this outline of the manners and customs
of ancient Egypt, we will take up the more immediate history
of Cleopatra. It will be remembered that Alexander
the Great, after his conquest of Egypt, founded the magnificent
city of Alexandria situated at the mouth of the
river Nile. One of the most expensive and famous of all
edifices erected by the Ptolemies was the light-house on
the island of Pharos, opposite to the city, and at some
distance from it a pier was subsequently built connecting
the island with the mainland. This light-house was a
lofty tower constructed of white marble. This great
edifice was erected by Ptolemy Philadelphus, the second
monarch in that line. It was regarded as one of the
seven wonders of the world. The architect of this light-house
was a man named Sostratus. Ptolemy ordered that
a marble tablet should be placed in the wall of the tower,
bearing his name as the builder of this wonder. Sostratus
seemingly obeyed, but he outwitted the haughty monarch.
Sostratus secretly engraved his own name upon the marble
tablet, and then covered it with an artificial cement similar
in appearance to the marble. On this outer surface
he cut the name of the king, and the tablet was placed
in the wall without detection. In process of time the
cement mouldered away as the architect had calculated
upon, and the king’s name disappeared, while that of
Sostratus remained as long as the building endured.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>The city of Alexandria was also world-renowned for its
immense library and museum established by the Ptolemies.
The museum was not a collection of curiosities, but an
institution of learning where sages congregated to devote
their time to the study of philosophy and science. The
institution was richly endowed, and very magnificent
buildings were erected for its use. The most valuable
books from all parts of the world were collected here,
the king buying, borrowing, or even stealing, these rare
treasures, when they could not be otherwise obtained from
neighboring nations; and scribes were kept constantly
employed in copying these works on parchment by handwriting,
as printing was then unknown, so far as can be
discovered; though it is hardly safe to assert that any
thing was unknown to those ancient Egyptians, for new
discoveries amongst the remains of their ruined cities are
continually revealing some hitherto unimagined fact regarding
the knowledge and civilization of that strange
and powerful nation. After copies were made of all these
valuable volumes, or scrolls, the original was always kept
in the Alexandrine museum and library, while the copy
was graciously returned to the owners, whether individuals
or nations. At length the library collected in the
museum increased to four hundred thousand volumes.
No more could be stored in the museum, and so a wonderful
temple, called the Serapion, situated in another
part of the city, was used as a depository for additional
volumes. Three hundred thousand volumes were
afterwards accumulated in this temple. The strange history
of this Serapion must not be omitted. One of the
ancient gods of the Egyptians was a deity named Serapis.
He was the particular divinity of seamen. A
statue of this god existed in the town of Sinope, in Asia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
Minor. The Ptolemy kings of Egypt were desirous of
making Alexandria the most important seaport and naval
station in the world, and they thought this could not be
accomplished without the presence of this sacred statue of
the god Serapis, as his worship would bring to their city
all the seamen who made pilgrimages to the shrine of
their god. The king of Sinope was unwilling to part
with the statue, and refused all offers of the Egyptian
king to purchase this venerated image of the deity. At
length, however, a famine fell upon the land of Sinope,
and the people in their distress were forced to part
with their sacred idol in order to obtain corn from the
Egyptians, who would furnish none without this condition.
The statue of the god Serapis was accordingly
brought to Alexandria, where a magnificent temple was
erected to contain the idol. This temple was called the
Serapion.</p>

<p>It was owing to the desire of the Ptolemies to make the
Alexandrine library the wonder of the world, that the
Old Testament of the Scriptures came to be translated
into Greek, which had previously been written only in
the Hebrew language, and was known only to the Jews.
This King Ptolemy having learned that the Jews at Jerusalem
possessed sacred writings which were guarded in
their synagogue there, was very anxious to obtain a copy
of them. As the Egyptians then held many of the Jews
in slavery, who had been taken prisoners in war, Ptolemy
rightly imagined that it would be difficult to accomplish
his purpose. He accordingly first bought all the Jewish
captives from their masters, at a cost of six hundred
thousand dollars, and sent the liberated Jews home to
Jerusalem. Deeming that he could now make his request
of the Jewish authorities with some hopes of success after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
this generous treatment of their countrymen, Ptolemy sent
a splendid embassage to Jerusalem, with respectful letters
to the high-priest, and very magnificent presents. The
request of Ptolemy was granted. The Jewish priests
made very fine copies of their sacred writings, illuminating
them with letters of gold. These were presented to
Ptolemy, and seventy-two learned Jews were chosen from
the twelve tribes and sent to Alexandria; and there they
translated the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek. This translation
is called the Septuagint, from the Latin words,
<i>septuaginta duo</i>, meaning “seventy-two.” A copy of the
Septuagint Bible may now be obtained for two days’
wages of a common laborer; but to secure the original
translation the Egyptian king expended, it is said, over
a million of dollars. Thus an Egyptian king gave to
the world the first Greek translation of the Old Testament.</p>

<p>Having given this glimpse of Egyptian history as a
background to our picture, we will confine the remainder
of this sketch to the immediate history of Cleopatra and
her family. Having shown the bright side of the picture
of the reign of the Ptolemies, we are forced to look
for a moment upon dark and bloody scenes. The early
sovereigns in the line of the Ptolemies were distinguished
for wise government and the advancement of
their people in arts, sciences, and literature. The first
Ptolemy was Ptolemy Soter, who, together with his son
and successor, Ptolemy Philadelphus, were the most illustrious
of the line. So greatly was Ptolemy Soter, the
founder of the dynasty, venerated by his subjects, that
divine honors were paid to his memory after his death.
But the succeeding Ptolemies grew more and more vicious,
weak, and sensuous, until the great-grandfather of Cleopatra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
stands forth in history merely as a horrid monster
of all vice and crime. He was Ptolemy Physcon, the
seventh in the line. The name Physcon was given him in
derision, on account of his grotesque appearance. Being
very small of stature, his gluttony and dissipation
had increased his rotundity of figure to enormous proportions,
making him more of a monster than man in appearance.
His brother, who was king before him, dying, left
a wife, who was also his sister, named Cleopatra, this
name being common in the family of the Ptolemies.
Queen Cleopatra had a little son, and a daughter, also
called Cleopatra, a beautiful girl of about fifteen years of
age. The son of this queen was really heir to the throne;
but the friends of Physcon succeeded in persuading Queen
Cleopatra to marry him, under the conditions that he
should be king, but that Cleopatra’s son, the child of
Physcon’s brother, should be heir to the throne. Physcon
agreed to this; but no sooner had he married the
queen, who was also his sister, when he brutally killed
her son, while in her own arms, and upon the very bridal
day. This inhuman monster then fell in love with the
young Cleopatra, his niece, and soon divorced the queen
and married her daughter. But so great were his cruelties
and crimes that the people rose against him, and he
was forced to flee for his life. He took with him a beautiful
boy, who was his own son, and also the child of the
Queen Cleopatra whom he had divorced. The people
then reinstated Queen Cleopatra upon the throne. When
the queen’s birthday arrived, it was celebrated with great
magnificence, and many guests were assembled at the
palace; at which time a large box was brought in as a
present to the queen. It was opened in the presence of
the guests, as all supposed that some neighboring monarch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
had sent some costly gift. As the cover was lifted,
what was the horror of the queen and her friends to behold
the head and hands of her beautiful boy, whom
Physcon had taken with him! These bloody relics were
placed amid a heap of the fragments of the body in such
manner that the mother might recognize her son, and the
fiend-like monster, in sending this ghastly gift, had commanded
that it should be presented to his former wife as
a birthday token, and that it should only be opened in the
presence of her guests. Such were some of the shocking
deeds performed by members of the family of the famous
Cleopatra. No wonder that her nature, inherited from
such inhuman monsters, was not free from barbarous
instincts.</p>

<p>The father of the illustrious Cleopatra was little better
than his revolting predecessors. Blood, murder, and intrigue,
and all crimes and vices formed his inheritance,
handed down by his grandfather, the fiendish Physcon.
The younger Cleopatra, whom Physcon married for his
second wife, became such an inhuman being of atrocity
and crime that she was put to death by one of her sons,
whose destruction she had planned in order to seize the
throne. The mother of Auletes, the father of the great
Cleopatra, was merciless and wicked, like the rest of the
line, disregarding every virtuous principle and family tie.
Her daughters were worthy followers of her atrocious
example, and at length one murdered the other in jealous
hate. Such was the bloody and shocking family record
which the world-renowned Cleopatra inherited, together
with the throne of one of the most powerful and remarkable
nations of the earth. Her father followed in
the same bloody footsteps. Having been dethroned by
his subjects, who hated him on account of his atrocious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
vices,—for this Ptolemy Auletes was one of the most
dissipated and corrupt of all the sovereigns of that
dynasty,—he fled to Rome to obtain aid to recover his
throne. The Egyptian people, meanwhile, had made his
eldest daughter, Berenice, queen. Auletes, having at
length raised an army with the help of Pompey, the
Roman general, who espoused his cause, returned to Alexandria,
defeated the Egyptians, and recovered his throne;
and immediately thereupon put his eldest daughter, Berenice,
to death. When Cleopatra was about eighteen
years of age, her father died, having left a will by which
the throne of Egypt was to be held by Cleopatra and her
younger brother Ptolemy, who were to marry each other
and reign conjointly.</p>

<p>This terrible deed, which is regarded with just abhorrence
as a dreadful and revolting crime in our days, was
a customary practice among Egyptian monarchs; and in
their mythology their gods and goddesses were also represented
as marrying brothers and sisters. As both Cleopatra
and her brother were too young to govern Egypt,
they only reigned in name, while the government was administered
by two ministers, named Pothinus and Achillas.
As these statesmen, one of whom was also general-in-chief
of the army, desired to obtain complete control
of the empire, they espoused the cause of Ptolemy, Cleopatra’s
brother and so-called husband, who was so young
that they imagined they could manage him as they wished.
They accordingly deposed Cleopatra, placing Ptolemy
alone on the throne; though in reality they were the sovereigns
themselves.</p>

<p>Cleopatra, who early displayed a dauntless courage and
a resistless self-reliance, fled to Syria to raise troops, that
she might secure by force her rightful inheritance. Cleopatra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
obtained an army, and commenced her march back
into Egypt. Pothinus and Achillas went forth to meet
her, accompanied by a large body of troops, taking the
young Ptolemy with them as the nominal sovereign. The
two armies encamped near Pelusium. But no battle was
fought, owing to unexpected circumstances.</p>

<p>It was at this time that the conflict was waging in
Rome between Julius Cæsar and Pompey. As Pompey
had given aid to Ptolemy Auletes, the father of Cleopatra,
in recovering his throne, Pompey fled to Egypt,
hoping to find succor there. But he was treacherously
invited to land by the Egyptian ministers, Pothinus and
Achillas, and then barbarously murdered while stepping
on shore. Julius Cæsar soon after arrived at Alexandria;
and when this news reached the camps of the Egyptian
armies, the two ministers, with the young king,
Ptolemy, hastily returned to Alexandria; and, hoping to
propitiate Cæsar, they sent to him the head of the murdered
Pompey. Cæsar, far from being pleased, was
greatly shocked, and ordered the head of his late enemy
to be buried with imposing ceremonies.</p>

<p>Cæsar had landed at Alexandria with only a few troops,
and had established himself in the royal palace. He demanded
the six thousand talents which Ptolemy Auletes
had promised for securing the alliance of Rome, which
had never been entirely paid. Cæsar also claimed that,
by the will of Auletes, the Roman people had been made
his executors; and he declared that, as consul of the
Roman people, it was for him to decide the dispute between
Cleopatra and her brother Ptolemy.</p>

<p>While matters were in this state, Cleopatra determined
to use stratagem in gaining her own cause.</p>

<p>She therefore sent a message to Cæsar, asking permission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
to appear before him. Cæsar thereupon urged her
to come.</p>

<p>Cleopatra then took a single boat, and with but few
attendants left the army secretly; and arriving at Alexandria,
she waited until nightfall, and then advanced with
a single servant to the wall of the citadel. This servant,
named Apollodorus, at the bidding of Cleopatra, rolled
her up in a bundle of carpeting, and, covering the package
in such a manner as to resemble a bale of merchandise,
he lifted it over his shoulder and carried it into the
city, and arrived unmolested at the palace. In answer to
the questions of the guards stationed at the gates of the
palace, he replied that he carried a present to Cæsar.
Whereupon he obtained access to Cæsar’s apartments;
and when his mysterious bundle was unrolled, even the
stern Roman general was fascinated by the vision of
loveliness which met his wondering gaze. Cleopatra
was at this time about twenty-one years of age. She
was of slender and graceful form, and renowned, not so
much for her regularity of features, as for an indescribable
charm and witchery of manner and expression. As
she pleaded her cause before the great conqueror, with
lively intelligence and quick wit and winning sweetness,
the conqueror became the conquered; and Julius Cæsar’s
heart became a toy in the hands of this fair young girl,
and her wishes became his law. He who had conquered
the known world was led captive by the charms of
this wilful, fascinating, star-eyed beauty of the Nile.</p>

<p>Cæsar immediately espoused Cleopatra’s cause with
great fervor. He sent for the young king, Ptolemy, and
urged upon him the expediency of restoring Cleopatra to
her rights as joint sovereign with himself. But the young
Ptolemy had now arrived at the age of wilfulness, and refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to give his sister her place as queen. He was,
moreover, very much vexed that Cleopatra had delivered
herself into the power of Cæsar. He left the palace in a
rage, tearing the diadem from his head, in his indignation,
and declaring to the people that he was betrayed.</p>

<p>Ptolemy and his officers did not have a large body of
troops in the city of Alexandria; for the main army was
still stationed at Pelusium, where Cleopatra’s army was
also encamped.</p>

<p>The populace were so inflamed by the representations
of Ptolemy and his ministers, who declared that Cæsar
had seized and imprisoned Cleopatra, that the excited
people rushed to make an attack upon the palace. Cæsar
had but a small force to guard the palace; but he boldly
sent out a detachment of his soldiers, with orders to seize
Ptolemy, and bring him as a prisoner. This was accomplished,
to the great astonishment of the people at such
unheard-of daring. Then Cæsar mounted to a high window
in the tower, and made signs to the mob below that
he wished to speak with them. Quiet being restored,
Cæsar told the people that, as he was a representative of
the Roman nation, whom Auletes had made the executors
of his will, he would endeavor to decide justly the questions
concerning Cleopatra and Ptolemy; and he recommended
them to retire without further riot. Accordingly
the mob dispersed, and Ptolemy and Cleopatra remained
under Cæsar’s guardianship.</p>

<p>The next day an assembly of the chief men of Alexandria
was convened by Cæsar; and the will of Auletes
having been publicly read in their hearing, the decision
announced by Cæsar, that Cleopatra was entitled to reign
with Ptolemy, was not openly opposed. Thereupon Cleopatra
was reinstated by Cæsar; and he proposed that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
her younger sister, Arsinoë, with a still younger brother,
also named Ptolemy, should receive the island of Cyprus
as a joint realm. Cyprus being at this time a Roman
possession, this provision would be a royal gift, which
Cæsar thought would help to appease the Egyptian people.</p>

<p>A grand festival was held to celebrate this reconciliation;
and during the feast one of the servants of Cæsar
overheard some remarks, which led to the discovery of a
plot which had been formed against Cæsar by the Egyptian
ministers, Pothinus and Achillas. Cæsar being informed
of the plan, set a guard at the door where the
feast was held, and Pothinus was killed. Achillas fled to
the Egyptian army, and assuming command, he marched
against Cæsar.</p>

<p>The war which now ensued is known as the Alexandrine
war. Achillas had at first the advantage in this
contest, as his army was large, while Cæsar had brought
but few soldiers with him to Alexandria, and his reinforcements
had not arrived. Cæsar, knowing the importance
of holding control of all the approaches to the city
by sea, sent out an expedition to burn all the shipping in
the harbor, and to take possession of a fort upon the
island of Pharos, which commanded the entrance to the
port. This undertaking was successful; but in its accomplishment
an irretrievable loss was sustained, not only by
the city of Alexandria, but by the entire world. This was
the burning of the famous library already described.</p>

<p>After various minor conflicts, a great battle was fought,
in which the Egyptians were defeated. Ptolemy, who
had previously joined the Egyptian army, was afterwards
drowned in the Nile.</p>

<p>The younger sister of Cleopatra, Arsinoë, who had escaped
from the palace with her guardian, called Ganymedes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and had taken refuge with the Egyptian army, was
captured by Cæsar’s soldiers, and brought to him as a
prisoner. The war being ended by the victory of Cæsar,
Cleopatra was placed upon the throne of Egypt, in conjunction
with her youngest brother, Ptolemy, as the elder
was dead; and after two years Cæsar returned to Rome,
taking Arsinoë with him as his prisoner. In his grand
triumphal celebrations this Egyptian princess was forced
to walk before the chariot of Cæsar, bound with golden
chains. Cæsar had become so infatuated with Cleopatra
that he had taken her as his wife, while in Egypt, although
he was already married to a Roman lady. And
after Cæsar’s return to Rome, Cleopatra followed him with
their infant son, named Cæsario, and her younger brother,
Ptolemy, who reigned with her as king of Egypt.</p>

<p>Upon the death of Cæsar, which occurred about four
years after, Cleopatra endeavored to get her child acknowledged
by the Roman senate as her colleague on the throne
of Egypt. She was living in Rome in Cæsar’s villa when
he met his death at the hands of the conspirators. She
thereupon applied to Cicero to use his influence in behalf
of her son Cæsario, and offered him some rare books and
works of art. But Cicero was offended at her haughtiness,
and refused to espouse her cause. Cleopatra, fearing
that her own life was in danger,—for the Roman people
were much incensed against her on account of her influence
over Cæsar,—then fled secretly to Egypt with her
son Cæsario. As Ptolemy, her youngest brother, had
now arrived at the age of fifteen years, at which time he
was allowed to assume all the royal prerogatives of a
sovereign, Cleopatra contrived to have him poisoned, that
she might reign sole monarch. She had then reigned
four years with her elder brother and four with the
younger Ptolemy, and from that time she reigned alone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>This shocking murder of her own brother reveals the
savage instincts which she had inherited from her ancestors,
who were guilty of the most atrocious crimes. She
had seen her own father murder her eldest sister out of
cruel revenge, and her childhood had been passed amidst
scenes of profligacy and vice. For a time her nobler impulses
had obtained the ascendancy over her; but from
this time forward all the marvellous fascinations of mind
and manner, which enslaved all who came within their
magic spell, were debased by evil motives, and became
the instruments of accomplishing the ruin of all who were
so unfortunate as to become infatuated with her alluring
beauty, melodious voice, and brilliant mind.</p>

<p>After the famous battle of Philippi and the death of
Brutus and Cassius, Octavius Cæsar and Mark Antony
and a Roman general named Lepidus formed the celebrated
<i>triumvirate</i>, which continued for some time afterwards
to wield the supreme power over the Roman world.
The battle of Philippi established the ascendancy of Antony,
and made him the most conspicuous man, as Cleopatra
was the most conspicuous woman, in the world.</p>

<p>After the murder of Cæsar, Cleopatra did not openly
declare herself a partisan of either his friends or enemies.
But as some suspicious circumstances occurred, Antony
afterwards summoned her to appear before him on a
charge of aiding Cassius. Antony was then at Tarsus,
and the famous sail of Cleopatra up the river Cydnus
took place at that time. The description of this gorgeous
scene we have already narrated. The name of the
messenger sent by Antony to summon Cleopatra to his
presence was Dellius. This officer had proceeded to
Egypt on this errand, but having beheld the far-famed
Egyptian queen, he was so astonished at her beauty and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
captivated by her fascinations of voice and manner, that
he told her she need have no fears of Antony, for he was
sure her matchless charms would speedily overwhelm him.
He advised her to proceed to Tarsus with as much pomp
and magnificence as possible, arrayed in her best attire,
and displaying all the gorgeous luxury of her court.</p>

<p>Cleopatra was not slow to follow this advice, but she
took her own time in obeying Antony’s summons; thus
already making him submit to her own sweet will. “The
great secret of Cleopatra’s power of winning was the instinctive
insight she possessed into men’s dispositions,
and her exquisite tact in discovering their vulnerable
points. She won Julius Cæsar by throwing herself into
his power, and won Mark Antony by exercising her power
over him. She flattered Julius Cæsar’s love of dominion
by submitting herself to it; she swayed Mark Antony’s
heart by assuming rule there. She caused herself to be
carried to Julius Cæsar; she bade Mark Antony come to
her. She behaved with humility and deference to Julius;
she treated Antony with gay despotism and wayward
playfulness. She derived her fortune and held her crown
from Julius Cæsar’s bestowal; she outvied Antony in
costly display and sumptuous entertainment. Her irresistible
allurement lay in her faculty of adapting herself
to men’s peculiar tastes and predilections. She followed
Julius to Rome; she shared Antony’s wildest frolics.
Antony’s passion for Cleopatra was a luxurious intoxication.”</p>

<p>When the magnificent barge of Cleopatra landed at the
city of Tarsus, all the populace ran to the river-banks to
behold the gorgeous sight. Antony, who was then engaged
at some tribunal, found himself completely deserted,
as every one had fled in haste to the river. When Cleopatra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
landed, she ordered her tents to be immediately
pitched upon the shore.</p>

<p>Antony sent a polite invitation to the Egyptian queen
to dine with him; but she courteously replied that it
would be more pleasing to her to receive him and his
generals as her guests. And when Antony and his officers
entered her superb tents, the gorgeous magnificence everywhere
displayed with most lavish abundance astonished
and bewildered them. The dinner service was of gold
set with precious stones, and the twelve seats arranged
for the guests were ornamented with purple and gold.
When Antony praised the splendor of the sight before
him, Cleopatra disdainfully replied that these were but
trifles; but if the service and ornaments pleased him, she
begged him to accept them all as a slight gift from her.
The next day Cleopatra was invited to dine with Antony;
and although he endeavored in every manner possible to
equal the richness and splendor of her entertainment, he
fell so far short, that he acknowledged with chagrin his
defeat. Again Antony and his generals were feted in the
tents of Cleopatra. This time the tables were spread with
a new service of gold and silver, more magnificent than
those beheld at the former feast. The rare jewels with
which they were adorned, and their unique and elegant
workmanship, surprised her guests into still warmer exclamations
of wonder and delight. At the end of the
entertainment Cleopatra presented to each guest the gorgeous
chair in which he had reclined, and distributed
amongst them all the splendid service of gold and silver
dishes, which were richly encrusted with costly jewels.</p>

<p>Not only were the entertainments furnished by Cleopatra
in honor of Antony so very gorgeous, but her costumes
were each day more bewitching, and even her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
attendants were attired in rich and expensive robes;
while the tents and surrounding gardens and pavilions
were illuminated with innumerable lights, which were so
ingeniously disposed, some in squares, and some in
circles, that the spectacle was surprising in beauty. Antony
was not only enchanted by the brilliancy of these
fairy-like scenes, but Cleopatra herself was irresistible.
She was not so remarkable for actual beauty,
but her chief fascination was the charming combination of
face, form, and winning conversation, which rendered her
bewitching. Her voice has been compared to an instrument
of many strings, so melodious was it; and she spoke
readily to every ambassador in his own language, and was
said to have been the only sovereign of Egypt who understood
the languages of all her subjects, which included the
Greek, Egyptian, Ethiopic, Troglodytic, Hebrew, Arabic,
and Syriac.</p>

<p>She was now twenty-five years of age. Her oriental
beauty was at its height of splendor. Her mind was
mature, and her wit was unequalled. These costly entertainments
continued every day; and on one occasion,
when Antony playfully reproached her for her extravagance,
and said that it would not be possible to fare in a
more costly manner, Cleopatra laughingly declared that
the dinner of the next day should cost ten thousand sestertia,
equal to three hundred thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Antony would not believe this surprising statement, and
made a wager with her that she could not fulfil her
promise. When he arrived with his generals the next
day, he did not perceive any seeming added magnificence;
and when Antony laughingly told her, that according to
his reckoning of the cost of the viands and service, she
had lost her wager, she replied, that she should herself
soon eat and drink the ten thousand sestertia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>She wore in her ears two pearls, the largest known in
the world, which she had inherited with her crown and
kingdom. These two pearls were valued at two hundred
and twenty-two thousand dollars apiece. Dryden, alluding
to these jewels of Cleopatra, wrote, “Each pendant
in her ear shall be a province.”</p>

<p>When the next course was served, a servant set before
her a glass of vinegar. She thereupon took one of the
ear-rings from her ear, and dropped it into the vinegar,
and when the pearl was dissolved, she drank the liquid.</p>

<p>As she was about to sacrifice also the other magnificent
jewel, one of the guests snatched it from her hand, exclaiming
that she had won the wager. This rescued pearl
was afterwards taken to Rome, and there cut in two and
made into a pair of ear-rings for the statue of Venus in
the Pantheon at Rome. And the fame of the wager made
the two half-pearls as valuable as the two whole ones had
been.</p>

<p>Cleopatra was also a beautiful singer, and she now employed
all the arts of her beauty and mind to the task of
completely subduing the will and the heart of the great
Roman general, who was soon so entirely ensnared by this
enchanting sorceress, that he forgot all about his wife,
whom he had left in Rome, and also his duties of country,
and even his glories of war; and thus this old warrior
became a willing captive to the spell of Cleopatra, who
persuaded him to follow her to Alexandria, and there he
gave himself up to every kind of idle amusement and the
most profligate dissipation.</p>

<p>Antony and Cleopatra had each a magnificent palace
in Alexandria, and they feted each other by turns. Philotas,
a young physician who was at that time pursuing
his studies at Alexandria, related to Plutarch’s grandfather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
some incidents of these extravagant feasts. At
one time Philotas entered Antony’s kitchen when eight
wild boars were being roasted whole. Upon expressing
astonishment at the large number of guests who must be
expected, to require such a dinner, the cook informed him
that there would be none others but Antony’s usual party
of twelve; but as each dish must be served in perfection,
and as Antony and Cleopatra often became engaged in
some new diversion just as dinner was ready, and would
thereupon give orders to have it wait their pleasure, it
was necessary to cook eight entire dinners, that whichever
one should suit their time to eat, it might be served
without the slightest signs of neglect in its preparation.</p>

<p>But the most costly of the luxuries then used in Egypt
were the scents and ointments. Many of these perfumes,
such as the attar of roses, were sold for four hundred
denarii the pound.</p>

<p>Cleopatra endeavored by every art possible to so fascinate
Antony that he would not think of returning to
Rome. Perceiving that Antony was partial to gross and
sensuous pleasures, and more given to feasting than the
polite arts and sciences, in which Cleopatra herself was
remarkably accomplished, she therefore cultivated only
the coarser side of her nature, and gave herself up to
the most riotous amusements. She played at dice with
him, hunted by his side, was present at all his military
parades, and even joined him in his night revels in the
street, when Antony, disguising himself as a servant, and
Cleopatra dressed as a maid, accompanied by half-drunken
companions, they went through the streets of Alexandria,
attended with boisterous musicians and singers, and perpetrated
all kinds of wild pranks.</p>

<p>Thus the elegant Cleopatra, who could charm Julius<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Cæsar with the marvellous intelligence and keen wit of
her conversation and the graceful allurements of her refined
beauty, when with the mad Antony, who was more
of a wild boar than statesman, laid aside her bewitching
loveliness of mind and manner, and condescended to join
in a wild revelry, as boisterous and undignified as his
coarser nature could enjoy. Yet even the witchery of her
youth, beauty, wealth, and gracefulness could not cloak
the enormities of vice and crime. Her first request of
Antony was the death of her sister Arsinoë, who had been
living in exile in Asia since the time when she had been
taken to Rome as a prisoner by Julius Cæsar. Either
from jealousy or ambition, Cleopatra desired her to be
put out of her way, and Antony caused her to be killed
in the temple of Diana, at Miletus, whither Arsinoë had
fled for refuge. Thus did Cleopatra continue her bloody
work even in the midst of her most gorgeous revels.</p>

<p>From henceforth in her history we can no longer think
of her as the lovely lotus of the Nile, the very flower of
womanly loveliness, as she appeared upon her enchanting
barge, sailing in the glowing sunshine, over the shining
waters of the Cydnus; but she becomes more like a beautiful
tiger, or, as Shakespeare calls her, “that old serpent
of the Nile,” charming the unwary victims by her glistening
eyes and alluring wiles, only to crush them at last
within the encircling coils of her irresistible spell. Antony
had sent for her as her master, but he was now her
slave.</p>

<p>One day the queen of Egypt accompanied him on a
fishing excursion. Antony, having caught nothing, was
much chagrined; and to appear successful in the eyes of
Cleopatra, he ordered a fisherman to dive beneath the
water and fasten to his line one of the large fish which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the fisherman had just caught. This having been done,
Antony drew in his line with much satisfaction, and displayed
the fine trophy he had so skilfully ensnared.
Cleopatra, however, was not ignorant of this artifice, but
she affected much admiration for Antony’s successful
angling, and she arranged for another fishing party the
next day. Accordingly, when they once again set sail in
the fishing-boats, she ordered one of her servants to dive
below the water when Antony should throw his line, and
fasten to his hook a large salt fish which had been brought
from the province of Pontus. Again Antony drew in his
line in triumph, which was quickly changed to intense
mortification as he beheld the salt fish dangling from his
hook. Amidst the uproarious laughter which this amusing
incident occasioned, Cleopatra exclaimed, “Leave the
line, good general, to us, the kings and queens of Pharos
and Canopus; your business is to fish for cities, kingdoms,
and kings.”</p>

<p>While Antony thus amused himself with such sports,
and much more condemnatory pleasures, news reached
him of trouble at Rome. His wife Fulvia and his brother
had been banished, and Octavius Cæsar declared himself
an open foe. Fulvia soon after died, and Antony returning
to Rome, was reconciled to young Cæsar by marrying
his sister Octavia, although Cleopatra already pretended
to be his lawful wife; and in order to appease her, Antony
was obliged to make magnificent presents to Cleopatra,
consisting of the provinces of Phoenicia, the Lower
Syria, the Isle of Cyprus, with a great part of Cilicia.
Cleopatra also begged him to put to death Herod, king of
Judea, and Malichus, king of Arabia, who were her enemies.
But Antony did not yield to these bloody demands,
and only gave her the balsam country around Jericho,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and a rent-charge of thirty thousand pounds a year on
the revenues of Judea. It is related that at a feast,
when Cleopatra perceived Antony to be under the influence
of wine, she even presumed to ask him to give her
the Roman Empire, which he was not ashamed to promise
her. On receiving these large additions to her kingdom,
Cleopatra, in honor of Antony, dated the years of her
reign anew, calling what was in reality the sixteenth year
of her reign over Egypt, the first, and thus she reckoned
them until her death. Antony also presented to her the
large library of Pergamus, which had fallen to his share
in the spoils of war. This library Eumenes and Attalus
had hoped to make as famous as the museum of Alexandria,
which had perished in the flames of the Alexandrine
war. Cleopatra placed the two hundred thousand volumes
thus acquired, in the temple of Serapis, and once again
Alexandria held the largest library in the world, notwithstanding
the destruction of the far-famed museum. These
royal gifts caused the Romans to entertain bitter hatred
against Antony, and especially against Cleopatra, whom
they blamed for her evil influence over their once illustrious
general.</p>

<p>After Antony’s marriage to Octavia, he made several
expeditions against surrounding nations, and Octavia
accompanied him into Greece. But open hostilities having
broken out between Octavius and Antony, Octavia
was sent to Rome to effect a reconciliation between her
husband and brother. This she partially accomplished;
but Antony, again ensnared by the enchantments of Cleopatra,
forgot all his duties of state and country, and again
was lured to Alexandria, leaving Octavia in Rome. This
illustrious Roman lady displayed the most loyal devotion
to her husband and their children, and endeavored in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
every way to dissuade her brother from taking up arms
against Antony, whose cruel neglect of his wife inflamed
her brother, Octavius Cæsar, to the most intense hatred,
and a determination to avenge her wrongs, as well as
assert his own ambitious power.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Antony was spending his time in Egypt.
At length he determined to undertake an expedition
against the Parthians and Armenians. While in Phœnicia,
Cleopatra joined him, bringing him money and
clothes and food for his soldiers. Meanwhile Octavia had
also left Rome and reached Athens, on her way to Antony’s
camp, to bring him the supplies and money she
had procured in Rome for his suffering troops. Fearing
that Octavia might win Antony from her side, Cleopatra
affected to die for love of him. She refrained from food,
and was often discovered by him in tears; and her attendants
constantly reminded him of her great grief, and
declared that if he should leave her, she would surely die.
As Antony had married Octavia only for political power
in Rome, and as he did love Cleopatra more intensely
than he had ever loved any human being before, he sent
word to Octavia to return to Rome, and soon after sent
deputies to Rome, to declare his divorce from Octavia,
and with orders to command her to leave his house, with
all her children.</p>

<p>Even this wicked and cruel indignity did not destroy
the devoted love of Octavia. She obeyed the outrageous
summons, and continued to take the most untiring care,
not only of her own children, but of those of Antony and
his former wife, Fulvia. She also endeavored to appease
the indignation of the Roman people against him; but she
could not lessen the resentment of her brother Octavius,
who now prepared for open war. While the names of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Antony and Cleopatra were held in abhorrence in Rome,
in Alexandria new and most gorgeous honors were accorded
them.</p>

<p>In the magnificent palace of the Ptolemies a massive
throne of gold was erected, the ascent to which was by
steps of solid silver. Upon this glistening throne sat
Antony and Cleopatra. He was arrayed in a superb robe
of purple, embroidered with gold, and buttoned with flashing
diamonds. On his side he wore a Persian scimitar,
the handle and sheath of which were encrusted with sparkling
gems. His diadem glittered with precious stones,
and in his right hand he held a sceptre of gold. Thus
had he caused himself to be so gorgeously attired, in order,
as he said, “that in such royal equipage he might deserve
to be the husband of a queen.”</p>

<p>Upon his right side sat Cleopatra, costumed as the
goddess Isis, whose name and honors she assumed on
public occasions of great pomp and magnificence. She
wore a shining robe of the precious linen set apart for
the service of that goddess, so fine and sheer that it
seemed to encase her graceful form in gleaming folds of
shimmering light. Upon her royal brow glistened most
priceless jewels, while her fair neck seemed almost weighted
with its sparkling gem-encrusted chains. She looked, in
truth, a very goddess, this proud Egyptian Queen, this
gorgeous Lotus Blossom of the Nile, this most matchless
siren, most peerless Peri of the Orient! Never before
had she appeared more gloriously beautiful; though even
now the black clouds of disappointment and death were
gathering thick around, soon to overshadow herself and
illustrious kingdom in irretrievable ruin. But unmindful
of the coming storm, the eyes of this Egyptian Isis, seated
in goddess-like magnificence upon her shining throne,
flashed with proud triumph and gratified ambition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>A little lower upon this gorgeous throne sat three children.
The eldest was Cæsario, the son of Cleopatra and
Julius Cæsar; the two younger were Alexander and
Ptolemy, sons of Antony and Cleopatra. Cæsario was
dressed as a young Egyptian prince; while the younger
boys wore the costumes of the countries over which they
were to reign. After the people had assembled in the
palace, by the command of Antony, heralds proclaimed
Cleopatra queen of Egypt, Cyprus, Libya, and Cœlosyria,
in conjunction with her son Cæsario. The young princes
Alexander and Ptolemy were also proclaimed “kings of
kings”; and to Alexander, the elder, Antony gave the
kingdoms of Armenia and Media, with Parthia, when
Antony should have conquered it. To the younger,
Ptolemy, the kingdoms of Syria, Phoenicia, and Cilicia
were given. After the proclamation the three young
princes knelt before Cleopatra and Antony, and made
them royal obeisance, kissing their hands. To each of
them was afterwards assigned a regiment of guards and
a retinue of youths chosen from the principal families in
the several countries.</p>

<p>Cæsar now advanced with his army against Antony.
Cleopatra, having furnished him with troops and ships,—which,
together with his own land forces, formed a large
army,—they departed to Ephesus, and thence to Samos,
where, notwithstanding their impending peril, they passed
many days in feasting and pleasure. The island became
such a scene of riot and revelry that the people exclaimed
in astonishment, “If Antony celebrates such festivities
before going into battle, by what means could he express
his joy should he obtain the victory?”</p>

<p>Antony and Cleopatra, with a magnificent retinue, then
went to Athens. As Octavia had been formerly received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
by the Athenians with marked attentions, Cleopatra determined
that she would outvie her rival. She accordingly
lavished such costly gifts and immense sums of
money amongst the Athenians, that they were amazed,
and decreed to her the most exalted honors. They sent
an imposing embassy to her, and Antony himself, in the
character of an Athenian citizen, was one of the ambassadors.</p>

<p>It was during one of the gorgeous feasts celebrated at
Samos that the following incident is supposed to have
occurred.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding Cleopatra’s professed fondness for Antony,
he began at length to fear that in some moment of
anger or treachery she might poison him. He therefore
ordered that all of the viands served at these banquets
should be first tasted by one of his servants before he
partook of them. Cleopatra, perceiving this mistrust,
determined to teach him how completely he was in her
power if she chose to do him harm.</p>

<p>She therefore ordered the stems of the flowers to be
poisoned, which formed the wreaths worn by Antony and
herself at table according to the Egyptian custom, and
in the midst of the feast she proposed that they should
pluck the flowers from their crowns and drink them in
their wine. Antony readily consented, and breaking off
many of the blossoms from his wreath, he threw them in
his glass and raised it to his lips to drink.</p>

<p>But Cleopatra quickly seized his uplifted arm and exclaimed:
“I am the poisoner against whom you take
such mighty precautions. If it were possible for me to
live without you, judge now whether I wanted either
opportunity or reason for such action.” She thereupon
immediately ordered that a prisoner, already condemned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
to die, should be brought into the apartment, and the cup
which Antony had been about to taste was given him,
and Cleopatra commanded that he should drink its contents;
after taking which, the slave immediately expired.</p>

<p>At length Antony and Cleopatra set forth with their
entire fleet to meet their Roman foes. This fleet consisted
of five hundred ships of war of great size and peculiar
construction; but they were illy manned, as Antony
was not able to secure mariners enough, and had been
obliged to employ husbandmen, artisans, muleteers, and
even boys. On board the fleet were two hundred thousand
foot and twelve thousand horse. The kings of
many countries had joined their forces in behalf of Cleopatra,
and troops had been sent from Libya, Cappadocia,
Paphlagonia, Comagena, Thrace, Pontus, Judea, Lycaonia,
Galatia, and Media. Though all the ships were imposing,
none equalled the magnificence of Cleopatra’s
galley with its purple sails glittering with gold; while
flags and banners floated in the breeze, and trumpets,
drums, cymbals, and other instruments filled the air with
gay and inspiring strains of martial music. Antony followed
her in a galley little less splendid.</p>

<p>Cleopatra was flushed with triumph. Accompanied by
one of the most renowned generals of the world, she
proudly threatened the powerful Roman capital, and
even dared to imagine that she could subdue the world
and reign sole mistress of the greatest kingdoms of the
earth.</p>

<p>Octavius Cæsar had only two hundred and fifty ships,
and eighty thousand foot and twelve thousand horse.
But his war-galleys were perfectly manned with experienced
seamen, and his troops were old veterans in many
illustrious wars.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>By the advice of Cleopatra, Antony determined to risk
all in a naval battle rather than a land conflict. Had he
chosen the latter, his superior numbers might have turned
the tide in his favor.</p>

<p>The important battle was fought upon the 2d of September,
in the Gulf of Ambracia, near the city of
Actium. While the battle was raging, and Antony’s
chances of success were equal with those of Cæsar, Cleopatra
turned and fled in fright, drawing after her the
entire Egyptian squadron.</p>

<p>Antony, perceiving her flight, forgot everything in his
wild impulse to follow her; and turning his galley, he
ignominiously pursued her, leaving his soldiers to carry
on the conflict. So bravely did they fight, even after this
shameful desertion of their leader, that Cæsar with great
difficulty gained the victory.</p>

<p>When Cleopatra perceived that Antony was following
her, she commanded her admiral to stop her galley until
Antony reached its side, when Antony was taken on
board. But so great was his mortification and remorse
that he would neither see her nor speak to her for three
days; after which time she regained her old ascendancy,
and they returned to Alexandria, where they gave themselves
up anew to pleasure and feasting, even though
they knew that Cæsar was already pursuing them.</p>

<p>Cleopatra now formed a very extraordinary design.
She ordered that her ships, which were in the Mediterranean
Sea, should be carried over the isthmus into the
Red Sea; and she then determined to take all her treasures,
and escape beyond the reach of Cæsar. But the
Arabians having burned several of her ships, she abandoned
the plan. She now resolved to be treacherous to
Antony, and to gain the favor of Cæsar. Though she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
loved Antony to madness, her ambition was stronger
than her love. She thereupon persuaded Antony to send
ambassadors to Cæsar to sue for peace; and with them
she sent officers of her own, who were bribed to treat
separately with Cæsar on her behalf. Octavius Cæsar
gave her reason to hope, if she would sacrifice Antony to
him.</p>

<p>Now followed a time of vacillating love and ambition,
despair and dissimulation. To dispel Antony’s suspicions
she increased her caressing attentions, and spent
her time in providing the most extravagant banquets and
amusements.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, with a presentiment of her impending
doom, she made special studies of all sorts of poisons,
to discern, if possible, which would occasion the most
speedy and painless death. She also experimented regarding
the effects of the bites of the most poisonous
reptiles and insects, using for her victims animals or
condemned prisoners. At length she discovered that the
asp was the only one whose bite occasioned neither torture
nor convulsions, the victim being speedily stupefied,
and dying in a seemingly painless sleep.</p>

<p>Antony and Cleopatra now formed a new compact,
called “Synapothanumenon,” signifying the order and
agreement of those who will die together, in substitution
for their former order of existence, called “Amimetobion,”
meaning “no life comparable.”</p>

<p>News at length reached Alexandria that Cæsar had
appeared before Pelusium, and that the city had fallen
into his hands. It is said that this capture was obtained
through the treachery of Cleopatra, who sent secret word
to her governor there to surrender the place. Then, to
clear herself from the rumors of this treason, she put the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
wife and children of the governor into Antony’s hands
that he might revenge himself by putting them to death.
Thus had vice and ambition robbed this Egyptian queen
of all the charms of innocence and womanly tenderness,
until she had become almost fiend-like in her cruelty and
selfishness. Thus can the spirit of selfish ambition become
a serpent in the heart, poisoning all its nobler
aspirations. The beautiful, fascinating Cleopatra was
fast becoming as great a monster of crime as her atrocious
ancestors.</p>

<p>Adjoining the temple of Isis, Cleopatra had caused a
magnificent tomb to be built for herself, and thither she
ordered all her most precious treasures to be brought.
She there stored her gold, silver, jewels, ebony, ivory,
and a large quantity of costly perfumes and aromatic
woods. She also sent to this mausoleum an immense
quantity of flax, tow, torches, and other combustibles,
which she ordered stored in the lower apartments of the
tomb, that they might be in readiness should she determine
to destroy herself and treasures by fire rather than
allow them to fall into the hands of her enemies.</p>

<p>Cæsar, hearing of these preparations made by the
Egyptian queen, was fearful lest she might escape him,
with all her treasures, and constantly sent her messages
offering her promises of generous treatment when he
should reach Alexandria.</p>

<p>Antony, knowing nothing of this double dealing, prepared
for a good defence. Cæsar had now advanced to
the city, and encamped near the Hippodrome. Antony
made a vigorous sally; and having severely repulsed
the enemy, he returned victorious to the city. But this
was the last effort of his expiring valor. On the morrow,
after spending the night at a magnificent banquet provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
by Cleopatra in honor of his recent success, Antony
resolved to attack Cæsar by sea and land. Having
drawn up his land force, he stood with them on an eminence,
watching the advance of his galleys, which were to
make the first attack. What was his horror and chagrin,
however, to behold Cleopatra’s admiral strike his flag, and
go over with his entire fleet to the enemy. This treason
opened the eyes of Antony to the perfidy of the queen.
With one expiring impulse of warlike valor, he sent to
challenge Cæsar to single combat. But Cæsar sent answer,
that if Antony was weary of life, there were other
ways to die. Finding himself thus ridiculed by Cæsar
and betrayed by Cleopatra, Antony rushed in wild rage to
the palace to avenge himself upon the perfidious woman
for whom he had bartered country and honor. Any excuse
which we might have made for the actions of Cleopatra
heretofore, on the plea that she was impelled by
her mad love for Antony, can no longer shield her
treachery and crime. It is poor Antony now who, in
spite of all his outrageous conduct, claims our sympathy.
He had bartered everything in life for the love of this
woman, only to find himself basely deserted by her in his
hour of greatest trouble. Her selfish ambition was paramount
to her love, and overshadows her last days with
infamy.</p>

<p>Cleopatra, foreseeing that Antony would seek her in a
rage, upon discovering her treachery, had retired into her
tomb, with two women attendants, and caused Antony to
be told that she had killed herself. No sooner had Antony
heard this news than his hate was again conquered
by his love, and lamenting her death with sobs and tears,
he shut himself up in his palace, with one slave, named
Eros. He thereupon commanded Eros to plunge his dagger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
into his heart, as he no longer desired to live. But the
faithful slave, unwilling to obey this dreadful command,
took the dagger, but stabbed himself with it, and fell dead
at his master’s feet. Antony then exclaimed, “Shall a
slave and a woman teach me how to die!” and immediately
thrust his sword into his side, and fell bleeding to
the floor.</p>

<p>Just then an officer arrived, who had been sent by Cleopatra
to inform him that she was not dead, as reported.
As soon as Antony heard the beloved name of Cleopatra,
he opened his dying eyes and begged to be taken to her,
that he might expire in her arms. Bleeding and dying, he
was carried to her tomb. Even then Cleopatra’s selfish
fear overcame her love, and she would not allow the
doors to be opened, lest her enemies might surprise her;
but she appeared at a high window, from which she let
down ropes to draw him up. Antony was made fast to
the ropes by his attendants below, and then Cleopatra and
her two women, who were the only persons with her in the
tomb, endeavored to draw up the dying Antony. It was
a piteous sight. With his eyes even now glazed in death,
Antony cast an imploring look upon the face of the
woman whom he loved more than life or earthly honors.
The handsome face of the Egyptian queen was distorted
by her grief and her severe efforts to draw up the bleeding
body of the dying Antony. When they had lifted
him within the window, Cleopatra laid him on a bed, and
bathed the blood from his face, caressing him with fond
kisses, and calling him endearing names. While she thus
wailed and mourned, she cut off his hair, according to an
Egyptian superstition that it afforded relief to the dying.
Antony, recovering consciousness for a few moments,
sought only to comfort her, telling her he died happy, as
he was in her arms.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>Cæsar allowed Cleopatra to bury Antony with royal
honors; and afterwards he went himself to pay her a
visit. He found Cleopatra overwhelmed with grief. She
had refused food, and endeavored to starve herself to
death; but Cæsar had sent her word that he would put
her children to death if she should harm herself, and so
she had reluctantly allowed herself to be ministered unto
by her physician. But she had bruised her face, arms,
and breast in her paroxysms of grief, and when Cæsar
entered her apartment, he was shocked at her appearance.
Her hair was loose and disordered, her countenance wild
and haggard, and her arms and breast horribly disfigured
with wounds and bruises, while her former lustrous eyes
were red and swollen by excessive weeping.</p>

<p>At first, Cleopatra endeavored to vindicate her conduct;
but finding that Cæsar was not awed by her hitherto irresistible
power, she broke down completely, and with tears
and lamentations sought to appeal to his pity. Cæsar
assured her that she would be treated with kindness and
generosity, and he left her, thinking that she desired to
live, and that his coming triumph would be graced by her
presence.</p>

<p>“Octavius little knew the subtle intrigues of Cleopatra.
She had deluded him; not he, her. The waning charms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of Cleopatra, dimmed by grief and sorrow, might not appeal
to the sensuous side of Octavius’s nature, but he was
not proof against the subtle and practised skill of her mental
abilities, by which she wielded the judgments of men
according to her will.”</p>

<p>Cleopatra now determined to destroy herself, that she
might not have to endure the ignominy of serving as an
ornament to Cæsar’s triumphal celebrations when he returned
to Rome. Once before, Cæsar had sent a messenger
to speak with her at the door of her tomb, while a
second officer placed a ladder against the wall and entered
her window, as he had been ordered to search her
apartment, lest she had some weapons concealed with
which she might harm herself. Whereupon, one of her
women cried out, “O unfortunate Cleopatra, you are
taken!” Cleopatra, seeing the officers, drew a dagger
from her girdle, and was about to stab herself, but the
officer caught her arm and took from her the weapon, and
afterwards searched the room and shook her robes, lest
she should have concealed some other weapon or poison
with which she could destroy herself. A guard was then
set in her tomb, to watch her constantly. But with all
these precautions, Cleopatra outwitted them. She sent
to Cæsar, and begged that he would allow her to go and
pay the last honors at the tomb of Antony and take her
final leave of him.</p>

<p>Cæsar having granted this request, she went with her
women, bearing chaplets and wreaths of flowers, which
they placed upon the tomb amidst wailings and lamentations.
When Cleopatra returned to her apartments after
this sad ceremony, she appeared more composed than
usual. After taking a bath, she arrayed herself with all
her queenly magnificence; and having ordered a sumptuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
repast, served with the customary splendor, she partook
of it with seeming calmness.</p>

<p>Afterwards, ordering all attendants to retire from her
presence, with the exception of two trusty waiting-women,
she wrote a letter to Cæsar, and then asked for a basket
of figs which a servant had just brought to her.</p>

<p>When the guards stopped him at the door, he displayed
the fruit, and declared that the queen desired them for her
dinner; and thus they were allowed to be sent in.</p>

<p>After Cleopatra had examined the figs, she laid down
upon her couch, and soon after appeared to have fallen
asleep. The poison from the bite of the asp, which had
been carefully hidden amongst the figs, and which had
stung her upon the arm, which she held to it for that
purpose, immediately reached her heart, and killed her
almost instantly, and without seeming pain.</p>

<p>When Cæsar received her letter, in which Cleopatra requested
that she might be buried by the side of Antony,
his suspicions were aroused, lest she contemplated killing
herself, and he sent officers quickly to her apartments.
But when they opened the doors, they found Cleopatra
lying dead upon her bed of gold, arrayed in all her royal
robes, and one of her women already lying dead at her feet.</p>

<p>The other attendant, named Charmian, was arranging
the diadem upon the brow of her beloved mistress, and
decking her form with flowers.</p>

<p>Seeing which, one of the soldiers exclaimed:—</p>

<p>“Is that well done, Charmian?”</p>

<p>“Very well,” she replied, “and meet for a princess
descended from so many noble kings.”</p>

<p>As she spoke these words, she, too, fell dead at her
mistress’s side. Both of these faithful slaves had probably
poisoned themselves, also, that they might die with
their much-loved queen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Cleopatra was buried in royal state by the side of
Antony, according to her request.</p>

<p>Cæsar, deprived of her much-desired presence in his
triumphal procession, ordered a statue of gold to be
made of the famous Egyptian queen, which was carried
before his chariot in his after-triumphs. The arm of this
statue was adorned with a golden asp, signifying the supposed
cause of Cleopatra’s death.</p>

<p>Cleopatra died at thirty-nine years of age, having
reigned twenty-two years. Cæsar caused all the statues
of Antony to be thrown down; but those of Cleopatra
were spared, as an officer who had been many years in
her service paid one thousand talents that they might
not be destroyed.</p>

<p>After Cleopatra’s death Egypt was reduced to a province
of the Roman Empire. The reign of the Ptolemies
had continued two hundred and ninety-three years.</p>

<p>Cæsario, the son of Cleopatra and Julius Cæsar, was
put to death by Octavius Cæsar; but her younger children
were taken to Rome and treated with kindness.</p>

<p>Thus perished the famous Cleopatra, whose marvellous
attractions and enchanting fascinations of beauty and
unequalled display of pomp and royal magnificence make
parts of her story to read like the wonderful tales of the
Arabian Nights; but whose selfish ambition, treachery,
and sins shrouded her last terrible end in the impenetrable
blackness of hopeless despair.</p>

<h2>ZENOBIA.<br>

<small>A.D. 260.</small></h2>

<div class="center">
<small>“She had all the royal makings of a Queen.”—<span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span></small></div>


<p class="drop-cap">LIKE an enchanted island rising suddenly before the
vision in mid-ocean, so did superb Palmyra of the
East burst upon the sight in the midst of an ocean of sands,
and cause the tired traveller, who had toiled painfully across
the weary wastes of the Syrian desert, to pause spellbound
and enraptured before the picture of unrivalled
loveliness which suddenly met his gaze, as he looked
towards the high land and waving groves of palm-trees
which marked the site of the magnificent Palmyra, “the
Tadmor in the wilderness,” said to have been founded by
Solomon as a resting-place for caravans in the midst of
the trackless desert.</p>

<p>Over sixteen hundred years ago this famous city flourished,
in the zenith of its gorgeous magnificence. Even
Rome paid homage to its power and beauty, and Roman
emperors thought it not beneath them to seek alliance
with the illustrious sovereign of this alluring realm.</p>

<p>Flanked by high hills on the east, the city filled the
entire plain below, as far as the eye could reach, both
north and south. Studded with groups of lofty palm-trees
shooting up among its temples and palaces of glistening
white marble, while magnificent structures of the
purest marble adorned the groves which surrounded the
city proper for miles in every direction, it appeared at
the same time all city and all country; and from a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
distance one could not determine the line which divided
country from city.</p>

<p>The prospect seemed to the beholder the fair Elysian
Fields, for it appeared almost too glorious for the mere
earth-born; while from its midst the vast Temple of the
Sun stretched upwards its thousand columns of glistening
marble towards the heavens, which bent above them its
dazzlingly blue vault flooded with the golden effulgence
of the mid-day sun, or glowing with the rich tints of an
oriental sunset.</p>

<p>This renowned Temple of the Sun was a marvel of
man’s architectural skill and genius. It was of dazzling
white marble, and of Ionic design. Around the central
portion of the building rose slender pyramids,—pointed
obelisks,—domes of the most graceful proportions, columns,
arches, and lofty towers, innumerable in number,
and of matchless beauty. The genius of Greece had
contributed to the beauty of this Palm City of the desert,
for on every side it was adorned with Grecian art and
architecture.</p>

<p>Nor was the Temple of the Sun its only marvel.
About half a Roman mile from the temple was situated
the Long Portico. This building was devoted to pleasure
and trade. Amongst its interminable ranges of Corinthian
columns the busy multitudes passed in ceaseless
processions, pursuing their various avocations or seeking
amusement. Here the merchants assembled, and exhibited
their rich stuffs gathered from all parts of the
known world. There, also, the mountebanks resorted, and
amused the crowds of idle rich with their fantastic tricks.
Strangers from all the known countries might have been
seen, attired in their varied and picturesque national costumes.
A continuous throng of natives from all climes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
passed to and fro, along the spacious corridors, between the
graceful, fluted columns surmounted by the rich entablature
whereon were carved the achievements of Alexander.</p>

<p>Nor were these the only points of interest in this fascinating
city. The royal palace rose in the midst, so vast,
and with so many shining turrets and massive towers,
that it seemed a city within a city.</p>

<p>Palmyra was laid out in shady avenues of luxuriant
palm-trees, and adorned on either side with magnificent
structures of white marble, or of stone equal in dazzling
whiteness. Public gardens, groves, and woods stretched
beyond the limits of the city, far as the eye could reach;
and amidst these cool and green retreats, elegant villas
of the rich and luxurious Palmyrenes were scattered so
thickly that Palmyra, the Beautiful, the Palm Grove,
seemed placed like a gem of matchless charms in the
red-gold setting of the desert sands.</p>

<p>Along the roads leading to the city, elephants, camels,
and dromedaries laden with merchandise, or gorgeously
caparisoned, bearing some noted personage, in strange
and brilliant costume, added picturesque dashes of varied
color to the landscape.</p>

<p>Just without the walls of the city were the vast arches
of the aqueduct which supplied the inhabitants with a
river of purest water.</p>

<p>The streets presented a never-ending scene of varied
beauty. The buildings of marble; the clean, paved streets;
the frequent fountains of water throwing into the perfumed
air hundreds of gleaming jets; temples, palaces,
and gardens on every side, entranced the eye with their
alluring beauty. Arabian horses with jewelled housings,
and riders of noble rank; then anon a troop of royal cavalry,
with clashing arms and clanging trumpets; with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
motley population of Palmyrenes, Persians, Parthians,
Arabians, Egyptians, Jews, and Romans, with their
varied costumes of glowing colors; here mounted on a
camel; there riding a stately elephant; some seated in
chariots drawn by white Arabian steeds of peerless beauty,
caparisoned with gold and jewels if their owners belonged
to royal families,—all these objects fascinated the gaze
of the bewildered stranger and riveted the attention of
the lover of artistic effects.</p>

<p>Such was beautiful Palmyra in the time of its famous
queen, Zenobia. And not less dazzlingly beautiful is the
fair queen herself, as she rides through the streets of her
royal city, where her adoring subjects flock to do her
homage.</p>

<p>See! she is returning from one of her expeditions to
her distant provinces, and is just entering her loved
Palmyra. As soon as the near approach of their queen
is made known to the people, the entire populace flock to
the walls to welcome her return. Troops of horse, variously
caparisoned, lead the queen’s procession, followed
by a train of elephants and camels with gay trappings
and heavily loaded. Then come the body-guard of the
queen, clad in complete armor of steel, surrounding the
royal chariot, which is drawn by six snowy Arabian steeds
with gold-mounted harness and bearing waving plumes
upon their high-arched heads. As the mid-day sun shines
with effulgent splendor upon the scene, the flashing of
spears and corselets and burnished chariots and gilded
harness sparkle like diamond points. Seated with stately
grace in the royal chariot, behold Zenobia! queen of this
resplendent realm and mistress of many kingdoms! while
the air resounds with the acclamations of the vast multitudes:
“Long live the great Zenobia! The blessing of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
all the gods on our good queen, the mother of her
people!”</p>

<p>Right royal is the bearing of the beautiful Zenobia,
well fitted in mien and manner for her regal state. Imperial
is her brow, and commanding are her dark, lustrous
eyes. But she is more than haughty queen; she is a loving
woman and a devoted mother, and she looks upon her
subjects with the same tender glance of sympathetic regard
that she casts upon the beautiful young princess
seated by her side. A helmet-crown rests upon her luxurious
black hair, which is partly confined in braided locks
and partly floating in the breeze. A rich tunic of golden
tissue adorns her form, and a mantle of purple silk,
fringed with tassels of sparkling jewels and clasped with
a dazzling diamond whose value would purchase a province,
gracefully enshrouds her left shoulder, leaving her
right arm bared above the elbow, where the swelling curves
were clasped by shining circlets of glittering gems. Her
complexion is dark, though not swarthy, for the smooth
brunette skin gleams with ivory tints and deepens to crimson
in her rounded cheeks, which time has not wrinkled, even
though she has been a matron for many years. When she
smiles in loving benediction on her adoring subjects, her red
lips part over teeth of dazzling whiteness, and her voice
thrills the listener with its rare cadences of melodious
tones.</p>

<p>The Palmyrenes were Egyptian in their origin and customs,
Persian in their luxurious tastes, Grecian in their
language, literature, and architecture. Zenobia claimed
descent from the Macedonian kings of Egypt. She fully
equalled in beauty her famous ancestor, Cleopatra, and
far surpassed her in character and valor. Some accounts
state that she was the daughter of an Arab chief, Amrou,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
the son of Dharb, the son of Hassan; though other writers
claim that Zenobia was a Jewess.</p>

<p>She was possessed of rare intellectual powers; was well
versed in Latin, Greek, Syriac, and the Egyptian languages.
The celebrated Longinus was her instructor,
and the works of Homer and Plato were familiar to her,
and she wrote with ease in Greek. She compiled an
oriental history for her own use, and found constant
delight in the arts and sciences when not engaged in the
severer pursuits of war.</p>

<p>Zenobia married Odenathus, a prince of great valor and
ambition, who was chief of several tribes of the Desert.
He rapidly made himself master of the East, and became
so powerful that the Romans made him their ally, giving
him the title of Augustus and General of the East. He
gained several victories, as the ally of Rome, over Sapor,
shah of Persia, and twice pursued his armies, even to the
gates of Ctesiphon or Ispahan, the Persian capital.</p>

<p>But in the midst of his victories Odenathus was assassinated
at Emæsa, while engaged in hunting. His murderer
was his nephew, Mæonius. Zenobia revenged the death
of her husband by destroying Mæonius, and as her three
sons were too young to rule, she first exercised supreme
power in their name, but later, declared herself queen of
the dominions of her husband, and assumed the royal diadem,
with the titles of Augusta and Queen of the East.</p>

<p>Zenobia was remarkable for her courage, prudence, and
fortitude, as well as for her intellectual gifts. No danger
unnerved her; no fatigue dismayed her.</p>

<p>Her husband, Odenathus, had been a great lover of the
chase, and Zenobia always accompanied him upon these
expeditions. Disdaining a covered carriage, she rode on
horseback in military habit, and pursued with ardor the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
exercise of hunting, unterrified, though the game might be
lions, panthers, and other wild beasts of the desert.</p>

<p>The success of Odenathus in his various wars was in a
large measure to be attributed to the marvellous foresight,
fortitude, and prudence of Zenobia.</p>

<p>She did not appear to be possessed of those petty passions
and weaknesses which female sovereigns have so
often displayed. She governed her realm with the most
judicious judgment and consummate policy. If it was
expedient to punish, she could calm her woman’s heart
into manlike stoicism, and silence the promptings of pity.
If, on the other hand, it were justice to pardon, she could
quell within herself all signs of personal resentment, and
display a magnanimous forgiveness.</p>

<p>Though on state occasions she clothed herself and her
court with regal magnificence and lavished money with a
bountiful hand, apparently regardless of the cost, yet so
strict was her economy in all her governmental affairs that
she was sometimes accused of avarice. She spent immense
sums for the adornment of her beautiful Palmyra,
and gathered around her philosophers, poets, artists, and
the great and rich from many lands.</p>

<p>As a queen, she was adored by her subjects and admiringly
feared by rival sovereigns. As a woman, she was
peerless among her cotemporaries, and illustrious among
the women of all times. Possessed of striking and alluring
beauty, she yet won more admirers for the beauties
of her intellect, rather than for her bewitching face and
stately form. And her voice, like that of Cleopatra, so
charmed the ear by its delicious cadences, that the echo of
its melodious tones has been wafted down the ages. As a
wife and mother, Zenobia stands far above the dazzling
Cleopatra, though she is said to have modelled her warlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
exploits after that renowned Egyptian enchantress of
the Nile; but she did not emulate her wicked coquetries,
nor copy her weaknesses.</p>

<p>Arabia, Armenia, and Persia solicited her alliance, and
she added Egypt to the dominions of Odenathus. The
emperor of Rome, Gallienus, refused to acknowledge
Zenobia’s claim to the sovereignty of her late husband’s
dominions, and twice sent an army against her, but was
twice defeated by the valorous and undaunted Zenobia.
Her dominions extended from the Euphrates to the Mediterranean,
and included Jerusalem, Antioch, Damascus,
and other cities famed in history. Zenobia, however,
made the beautiful Palmyra her place of residence, making
expeditions to her other provinces. Her three sons,
Timolaus, Herennianus, and Vaballathus, were educated
with care; and they were attired in the Roman purple of
the Cæsars and brought up according to Roman manners.
The appointments of her palaces were gorgeously magnificent,
and her style of living most regal; she affected great
splendor in her attire, always appearing in royal state,
dazzling with jewels, unless at the head of her army or
riding in the chase, when she wore military habits, which,
however, sparkled with gems; and though an apparent
amazon, she was a woman of dazzling beauty and most
fascinating presence, and always appeared before her
council of war in regal pomp, which secured her an homage
from her subjects and her soldiers which amounted
almost to a worship which partook of the veneration and
admiration accorded to a goddess. She was pure in her
manners to the utmost refinement of delicacy, and was as
much adored for her womanly virtues as she was admired
for her warlike valor. At length the fierce Aurelian
became emperor of Rome. He was highly indignant that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
a woman should dare to claim proud Rome as her ally,
and defy his power. Having subdued all his competitors
in the West, he turned his arms against this powerful
queen of the East, who dared to call herself Augusta and
clothe her sons in Roman royal purple. Proudly the
Roman emperor approached the dominions of the haughty
Zenobia. Rumor announced his coming, and the dauntless
queen of Palmyra prepared to meet him. Neither
Roman legions nor Roman emperors made her brave
spirit quail or her woman’s heart grow faint.</p>

<p>When the first Roman herald reached Palmyra to
announce the coming of the Roman ambassadors who had
been sent by Aurelian to demand her submission, Zenobia
was related to have been at her hunting-villa just without
the city. It was in the forests lying to the north of this
summer palace that she pursued the wild boar, tiger, or
panther in the daring chase. As the messengers of
Aurelian arrived at the palace gates, the queen had just
returned from the hunt. Never did she look more regal.
She was mounted upon a white Arabian steed of peerless
beauty, caparisoned with harness gleaming with jewels.
Zenobia was leaning upon her long hunting-spear. She
wore upon her head a Parthian hunting-cap adorned with
a long white plume, fastened by a glittering diamond
worth a king’s ransom; her costume was also Parthian,
and was most perfectly adapted to display the exquisite
proportions of her graceful form. Her dark eyes were
flashing with scarcely less brilliancy than the diamond
which adorned her brow, as she sat her horse with regal
dignity, and her countenance betokened her dauntless
pride and warlike courage as the messengers of her
enemy were announced. Not waiting to dismount, she exclaimed
with tones of imperial command, “Bid the servants
of your emperor draw near, and we will hear them.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Announced by trumpets and followed by their train,
the ambassadors of Aurelian advanced to the spot where
Zenobia calmly awaited them, surrounded by her royal
attendants.</p>

<p>“Speak your errand,” said the queen.</p>

<p>“For a long series of years,” replied the ambassador,
“the wealth of Egypt and the East flowed into the Roman
treasury. That stream has been diverted to Palmyra.
Egypt, Syria, Bithynia, and Mesopotamia were dependents
upon Rome, as Roman provinces. The queen of
Palmyra was once but the queen of Palmyra; she is now
queen of Egypt and of the East,—Augusta of the Roman
Empire,—her sons styled and arrayed as Cæsars.
By whatever consent of former emperors these honors
have been won or permitted, it is not, we are required to
say, with the consent of Aurelian. While he honors the
greatness and genius of Zenobia, he holds essential to
his honor and the glory of the Roman world, that the
Roman Empire should again be restored to the limits
which bounded it in the reigns of the Antonines.”</p>

<p>“You have spoken,” replied Zenobia to the ambassadors,
with a calm voice and steady glance, “with plainness,
as it became a Roman to do”; and then her eye
flashed with proud disdain as she drew her stately form
up to still more lofty proportions, and she continued:
“Now hear me, and as you hear, so report to him who
sent you. Tell Aurelian that what I am, I have made
myself; that the empire which hails me queen has been
moulded into what it is by Odenathus and Zenobia; it is
no gift, but an inheritance, a conquest, and a possession;
it is held, not by favor, but by right of birth and power;
and when he will give away possessions or provinces
which he claims as his, or Rome’s, for the asking, I will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
give away Egypt and the Mediterranean coast. Tell him,
that as I have lived a queen, so, the gods helping, I will
die a queen; that the last moment of my reign and my
life shall be the same. If he is ambitious, let him be told
that I am ambitious too—ambitious of wider empire, of
an unsullied fame, and of my people’s love. Tell him I
do not speak of gratitude on the part of Rome; but that
posterity will say that the power which stood between
Rome and Persia, and saved the empire in the East,
which avenged the death of Valerian, and twice pursued
the Persian king, even to the gates of his own Ctesiphon,
deserved some fairer acknowledgment from an ally whom
its arms had thus befriended than the message you now
bring from your Roman emperor.”</p>

<p>With proud dignity the ambassadors were then dismissed,
and Zenobia prepared to defend her rights and
kingdom. Nor did she indolently permit the emperor of the
West to approach the gates of her fair Palmyra. With
brave rashness she went forth to meet him, and two great
battles were fought, one near Antioch, and the second
near Emæsa. In both these contests the brave Zenobia
herself led her troops to the onslaught, giving the second
place in command to her valiant warrior Zabdas, whose
great prowess in arms had hitherto made him a successful
general. But in both these battles Zenobia was defeated,
and she was forced to fall back within the gates of Palmyra.
Here she made a brave and last defence. And
again she boldly defied Aurelian from her towers, as she
had already defied him on the field of battle. So great
was her courage and so valiant her defence, that Aurelian
was obliged to admit her claims of being a most powerful
and determined foe, and thus wrote of her: “Those
who speak with contempt of the war I am waging against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
a woman, are ignorant of both the character and power of
Zenobia. It is impossible to enumerate her warlike preparations
of stones, of arrows, and of every species of
missile weapons and military engines.”</p>

<p>So doubtful was Aurelian of the result of the siege,
that he offered terms of an advantageous capitulation to
the brave queen of Palmyra; but she indignantly rejected
his proposals in a famous Greek epistle, in which she defied
his power. Zenobia, expecting reinforcement from
her provinces, and thinking that Aurelian, being encamped
in a desert, could not long hold out, especially as he was
constantly harassed by bands of Arabs attacking his army
in the rear, felt confident that the siege would not be
prolonged. But Aurelian, incensed by her haughty letter,
roused himself to greater vigilance, cut off all her supplies
as the several companies of her allies approached, and
found means to subsist his army even in the desert. At
length the city could hold out no longer. Zenobia determined
to fly, and endeavor to raise succor for her beloved
city in her surrounding provinces. Such, indeed, was the
reason assigned for this apparent cowardice on her part,
which was so contrary to her previous record of undaunted
bravery. Mounted on the fleetest of her dromedaries, she
succeeded in reaching the banks of the Euphrates, but
she was pursued and taken captive, and brought into the
presence of the Roman emperor. Aurelian sternly demanded
how she dared thus defy the power of Rome.
Still every inch a queen, and yet not forgetting a wise
policy, she replied, “Because I disdained to acknowledge
as my masters such men as Aureolus and Gallienus. To
Aurelian I submit, as my conqueror and my sovereign.”</p>

<p>While this conference was being held in the tent of the
Roman Emperor, the Roman soldiers came rushing in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
riotous mass, demanding the instant death of Zenobia.
But notwithstanding her previous bravery and fortitude,
history records that, in this moment of terrible danger,
Zenobia did not display equal courage to the famous
Cleopatra, who resolved to die rather than submit to her
Roman conqueror. It is stated that Zenobia laid the
blame of her obstinate resistance upon the aged Longinus
and others of her chief counsellors, in order to save her
own life. Whether this were indeed the truth or not, the
facts are that the great philosopher Longinus, and other
chief men of Palmyra, were put to death by Aurelian, and
the life of Zenobia was saved. But for this seeming betrayal
of her most faithful subjects, Zenobia may not have
been to blame; for the desire to preserve the haughty
Queen of the East, in order that she might grace his coming
triumph in Rome, was a sufficient reason to account for
Aurelian’s conduct in saving her life, and putting to death
her chief men, without it being necessary to ascribe to
such a brave and noble woman as Zenobia such ignoble
and cowardly actions. That she did not take her own
life like Cleopatra, but bore her reverses with calm dignity,
appears in these more enlightened days to be surely
more to her credit than to her dishonor; and in the light
of modern civilization, the picture of the beautiful
Zenobia, walking with firm step and imperial bearing
among the captives of the Roman conqueror, excites deeper
feelings of admiration than Cleopatra, the suicide, lying
dead upon her royal bed of state.</p>

<p>Palmyra being conquered, Aurelian seized upon its vast
treasures, and leaving there a Roman garrison, he started
to return to Europe, carrying with him Zenobia and her
family. But having reached the Hellespont, tidings came
to him that the Palmyrenes had revolted. Aurelian immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
retraced his steps, and arriving before Palmyra,
he ruthlessly destroyed that beautiful city, sparing neither
old men, women, nor children, in his bloody work of total
destruction. The gorgeous buildings were soon smoking
heaps of ruins; and though he afterwards repented of his
wild fury, and sought to rebuild in part a few of its
magnificent structures, it was too late. Palmyra became
desolate; and until about a century ago, when some English
travellers discovered its ruins, the very site where
once stood this beautiful Palm City of the Desert had
been completely forgotten.</p>

<p>Upon Aurelian’s return to Rome, his triumph was celebrated
with extraordinary gorgeousness and pomp. Vast
numbers of elephants, tigers, and other strange beasts
from the conquered countries presented a novel sight to
the wondering Romans. Sixteen hundred gladiators, who
were devoted to the cruel contests of the amphitheatre,
followed the line of strange beasts. Then appeared the
ensigns of the conquered nations, and the magnificent
plate, jewels, and royal robes of the Queen of the East
were displayed in immense profusion. Ambassadors of
Æthiopia, Arabia, Persia, Bactriana, India, and China,
attired in their rich and striking national costumes, revealed
the extent of the Roman power. After these came
the long lines of captives, including Goths, Vandals, Sarmatians,
Alemanni, Franks, Gauls, Syrians, and Egyptians.
But every eye was riveted upon the famous Zenobia,
Queen of the East. Arrayed in her royal robes, and
covered with her blazing jewels, the weight of which was
so overpowering as to cause her almost to faint under the
burden, she walked before her own magnificent chariot, in
which she had hoped to enter Rome as a conquerer, rather
than thus walk a captive. Her arms were bound with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
fetters of gold, which were so heavy that slaves were
obliged to assist in supporting them on either side. But
though her delicate form was bent by the weight of her
galling fetters,—gold though they were,—her proud eyes
were undimmed by tears, and her queenly head was carried
with imperial grace.</p>

<p>There are two accounts of the after-fate of Zenobia.
Some writers state that she starved herself to death, refusing
to outlive her own downfall and the ruin of her
country. But according to other records, the Emperor
Aurelian bestowed upon her a magnificent villa at Tivoli,
where she resided in great honor, her daughters marrying
into noble Roman families, while her youngest son became
king of a part of Armenia.</p>

<h2>MATILDA OF FLANDERS.<br>

<small>A.D. 1031-1083.</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The little work-tables of women’s fingers are the playgrounds
of women’s fancies, and their knitting-needles are fairy wands by
which they transform the whole room into a spirit isle of dreams.”—<span class="smcap">Richter.</span></p></div>


<p class="drop-cap">MATILDA of Flanders deserves mention for three
reasons. First, because she was the wife of
William the Conqueror; secondly, because she was the
first consort of the kings of England who was crowned
and who received the title of <i>la reine</i>. For, on account
of the crime of Edburga in poisoning her husband, Brihtric,
king of Wessex, a law was made debarring the
consorts of Anglo-Saxon kings from sharing in the honors
of royalty. Previously to the time of William the Conqueror,
who chose to ignore this law, the wife of the king
had simply held the title of “The Lady, his Companion.”</p>

<p>The third reason which has made Matilda of Flanders
worthy of mention is on account of the famous Bayeux
Tapestry, the work of her own royal fingers, which is still
preserved in the cathedral of Bayeux.</p>

<p>Cleopatra and Zenobia are illustrious for their warlike
valor and remarkable learning; but Matilda of Flanders
has made famous the needle, rather than the sword; and
with that little domestic instrument, the industrious fingers
of the first Norman queen, assisted by her attendant
ladies, gave to the world a very important historical
document, whereon was pictorially chronicled the famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
Norman conquest of England. And thus the sword of
the king and the needle of the queen have become indissolubly
associated in the history of this momentous mediæval
event.</p>

<p>Matilda was directly descended from Alfred the Great.
She was the daughter of Baldwin V., count of Flanders.
Her mother was Adelais, daughter of Robert I., king of
France.</p>

<p>Matilda was born about the year 1031, and was possessed
of much grace of form, as well as an attractive
face.</p>

<p>In those days, skill in needle-work was held as the
highest accomplishment for ladies of rank, and the
remarkable skill in this handicraft, displayed by the four
sisters of King Athelstan, is said to have secured for them
the addresses of the most eligible princes in Europe.</p>

<p>Matilda had several suitors, but she fixed her heart upon
a young Saxon noble named Brihtric, who on account of
the fairness of his complexion was called <i>Meaw</i>, meaning
“snow.” He was the Lord of Gloucester, and was made
envoy at the court of Flanders by King Edward the Confessor.</p>

<p>But he did not return Matilda’s love, and he afterwards
married another; this slight Matilda never forgot, and in
time she retaliated.</p>

<p>But Matilda, though ignored by the Saxon, was most
chivalrously loved by the bravest prince of all the courts—William
of Normandy. This prince was the son of
Duke Robert, though his mother was of humble birth;
but as his father had no other heirs, he declared this child
his lawful successor to the ducal throne, and then Duke
Robert departed upon his pilgrimage to the Holy Land,
from which he never returned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>William was educated at the court of Henry I. of
France, where he remained until the Normans sent to
claim him as their duke.</p>

<p>At the time when William sought the hand of Matilda
of Flanders in marriage, he asserted that Edward of England
had named him his heir; but some looked upon this
as an idle boast, and fair Matilda seems to have been so
little in love with her warlike cousin, that he sued for her
for seven years in vain. At last, determining to prove that
a “faint heart never won a fair lady,” he resorted to a
most uncommon and hazardous mode of courting.</p>

<p>For seven long years he had wooed Matilda, who,
absorbed in her vain fancy for the indifferent Lord of
Gloucester, turned a deaf ear to brave William’s glowing
ardor, until at length he was roused to desperate boldness.</p>

<p>One morning, as Matilda was returning from early mass
in the city of Bruges, she was suddenly confronted by the
unexpected appearance of Prince William, who, with glaring
eyes and lips quivering with intense passion, accused
her of loving Brihtric of Gloucester; and as she disdained
to deny it he cried in bitter tones:—</p>

<p>“Edward, England’s king, has named me his heir, and
by the holy cross, the Saxon churl who dares aspire to thy
hand, shall ere long be crushed by the vengeance of our
royal resentment.”</p>

<p>“Mighty words, easily spoken, and verily proof neither
of greatness nor of valor,” replied the princess; then,
laughing aloud in his face with disdainful manner, she
continued: “The doubtful Duke of Normandy, monarch
of England!—truly, a most excellent joke! But why
does not my aspiring and politic cousin declare himself
the future emperor of all Christendom?”</p>

<p>Stung by her sarcastic words and the implied insult regarding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
his birth, Prince William was driven to a frenzy
of anger; he seized Matilda, rolled her in a muddy pool
near by, and even struck her, in his wild fury, and leaving
her fainting upon the ground, he leaped upon his
charger, and galloped out of town. Strange wooing,
surely! and yet after-events would seem to imply its efficacy.
Truly, none but a William the Conqueror would
ever again have dared to enter Matilda’s presence. Matilda’s
father, incensed at the treatment his daughter had
received, made war upon William of Normandy; but the
king of Flanders was so badly beaten in the contest that
he was glad to make terms of peace with his Norman conqueror.
As Brihtric, the Saxon lord, refused to marry
the princess of Flanders, Matilda’s love turned to hate,
and she received the victor, William, when, with amazing
boldness, he renewed his suit, with every mark of courteous
forgiveness, and consented to accept him, declaring
“that she thought the duke must be a man of the highest
courage and most daring spirit, to come and beat her in
her father’s city.” “So faithful in love and so dauntless
in war,” this brave knight won his bride; and never was
wooing so fiercely bold, nor fair lady so strangely won.
King Baldwin V. of Flanders was only too ready to receive
this brave knight as a son-in-law, and quickly concluded
the marriage contract, having already had sufficient
experience of the powerful sword of this fierce wooer.
Matilda and William were married at Château d’Eu, in
Normandy; and her father gave her a rich dower, in
lands, money, jewels, and costly trousseau. William then
conducted his bride with much pomp to his duchy; and
she made her public entry into Rouen in magnificent
array. The bridal mantles of William and Matilda, richly
adorned with jewels, were long preserved in the treasury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of Bayeux Cathedral. As William and Mary were cousins,
the Archbishop of Rouen declared that their marriage
was illegal, and excommunicated them. But the dauntless
William was not to be terrified by any monkish bulls,
and appealed to the Pope, who nullified the sentence of
the archbishop, and sanctioned their marriage, on condition
that they should each build an abbey at Caen, and
found a hospital for the blind. This they willingly agreed
to do; and Matilda, who possessed much taste in architecture,
took great delight in the erection of the stately
abbeys of St. Stephens and the Holy Trinity; the former
was endowed by William, for the monks, and the latter by
Matilda, for the nuns.</p>

<p>Normandy enjoyed peace and prosperity under the wise
rule of William and Matilda, who were much beloved by
their subjects. Their children were remarkable for beauty
and promise, and were carefully educated under their
mother’s supervision.</p>

<p>About this time, Harold, brother to Queen Edith of
England, was taken prisoner by the sovereign of Ponthieu;
and as a brother of Harold had married a sister of
Matilda, William compelled the Earl of Ponthieu to release
Harold, and then he invited the Saxon prince to
Normandy, where he was betrothed to one of the young
daughters of William and Matilda, after which Harold
returned to England; but no sooner had Edward, king of
England, breathed his last, than Harold seized upon the
sovereign power, notwithstanding he had made a promise
to William of Normandy to assist him in gaining his
rights as heir to King Edward.</p>

<p>William thereupon invested Matilda with the regency
of Normandy, and associated with her their eldest son,
Robert, and prepared to invade England, and assert his
claims as the successor of Edward the Confessor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Unknown to her husband, Matilda had ordered a magnificent
ship of war to be built; and when William arrived
at the port of St. Vallery, he found this splendid present
from his wife awaiting him, and gorgeously adorned in
his honor. This ship was called the <i>Mora</i>, and in it
William embarked at the head of his fleet.</p>

<p>The Norman fleet reached the port of Pevensey, on the
coast of Sussex, in safety; but as Duke William was
landing, he fell headlong upon the ground. “An evil
sign is this!” exclaimed the superstitious Normans in
affright. But the duke, rising with his hands full of
sand, cried: “I have seized England with my two hands,
and that which I have seized I will maintain.” And most
truly did he fulfil this prophecy; and by the bloody battle
of Hastings the proud realm of England became the
dominion of the Norman conqueror.</p>

<p>Matilda, the Duchess Regent of Normandy, received
the welcome news of her husband’s victory while at worship
in the Church of Nôtre Dame, near St. Sever. She
thereupon ordered that the cathedral should henceforth
be called the “Church of Our Lady of Good Tidings.”</p>

<p>William re-embarked for Normandy to rejoin Matilda,
in March, 1067; but scarcely had he arrived in his
dukedom, ere tidings reached him of a revolt in England.
He immediately returned, quelled the insurrection,
and then sent for Matilda and their children to join him
in England.</p>

<p>Matilda arrived in England with her family soon after
Easter. William now made preparations for her coronation.
As I have mentioned, former wives of the sovereigns
of England had not received this honor. But
William the Conqueror would allow no obstacles to defeat
his purposes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Although William had already been crowned in Westminster
Abbey, he chose to be now re-crowned at Winchester,
that Matilda might be made queen.</p>

<p>It was during the ceremony of Matilda’s coronation
that the office of champion was first instituted. During
the banquet, a brave cavalier named Marmion, clad in
complete armor, rode into the hall and pronounced this
challenge:—</p>

<p>“If any person denies that our sovereign lord, William,
and his spouse, Matilda, are king and queen of
England, he is a false-hearted traitor and liar; and I, as
a champion, do here challenge him to single combat.”</p>

<p>This challenge was repeated three times, but no one
accepted it; and henceforth Matilda was always addressed
as <i>la reine</i>.</p>

<p>But Matilda had never forgiven the slight she had
received, as a girl, from the proud Lord of Gloucester;
and no sooner had she become queen of England than
she determined to take an unworthy revenge, which ever
after tarnished her fame.</p>

<p>She obtained from King William the grant of all the
possessions of Brihtric Meaw, and caused that unfortunate
Saxon, whose only crime had been indifference to
her youthful charms, to be imprisoned in Winchester
Castle, where he died. She even deprived the city of
Gloucester of its charter, and brought ruin to its inhabitants,
probably because they had dared bewail the fate
of their lord, her enemy.</p>

<p>Queen Matilda now commenced her famous Bayeux
Tapestry, illustrating the conquest of England by William
the Conqueror. In the cathedral of Bayeux, where
it is still preserved, it is called the “Tapestry of Queen
Matilda.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>This remarkable piece of canvas is nineteen inches
wide and sixty-seven yards in length. Upon it are
worked in cross-stitch many hundreds of figures, of men,
horses, birds, trees, houses, castles, churches, ships, and
battle scenes.</p>

<p>A dwarf artist, named Turold, is supposed to have
made the designs for Queen Matilda, and he has cunningly
introduced his own effigies and name into the
work.</p>

<p>Matilda’s table, while in England, was furnished at the
daily expense of forty shillings; and twelvepence each
were allowed for the maintenance of her attendants.
She received from the city of London oil for her lamp,
wood for her hearth, and imports on goods landed at
Queenhithe.</p>

<p>At this time, also, the famous curfew bell was established,
which was the signal that all lights and fires must
be extinguished at eight o’clock in the evening. This
was an old Norman custom, but it occasioned great dissatisfaction
among the English.</p>

<p>So frequent were the revolts among his English subjects,
that at length William thought best to send Matilda and
their children back to Normandy, where she resumed the
regency. She did not reside in England after this time.</p>

<p>Robert, the eldest son of William and Matilda, now
occasioned his parents much trouble. At last the quarrel
between father and son resulted in open war.</p>

<p>Matilda, whose excessive partiality for her eldest son
much offended her husband, supplied the rebellious Robert
with large sums of money; and when means failed her,
she even parted with her plate and jewels to aid her
favorite child. William was in England when the news
reached him of the rebellion of Robert and the part Matilda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
was taking in the matter, and he immediately set
out for Normandy. Upon arriving there, and learning
the truth of these rumors, he met his wife with bitter reproaches.
There was stern grandeur, not unmixed with
tender pity and love, in the harsh words which he addressed
to Matilda, which were not entirely unmerited;
and there was also a sublime depth of mother’s love in
her reply. Fixing his eyes upon the queen, the Conqueror
exclaimed with trembling voice:—</p>

<p>“The brightest jewel of my bosom hath pierced my
heart with the deadly dart of treachery. Behold, my
wife!—the treasure of my soul—to whom I have confided
my wealth, my crown, my greatness, my all. She
hath supported my rebel son in perfidy, and aided him to
raise his sword against his own father.”</p>

<p>“My lord!” replied Matilda, “far be from me to do
you wrong. But when you spurn our firstborn and retain
from him his rights, you drive him to wretchedness and
distraction. Be not surprised if I feel a mother’s tenderness
for her child. Nay, so much do I love him, that for
his dear sake I would dare any danger, do any deed.
Ask me not to enjoy the pomp of royalty while he is
pining in want and misery; as a loving husband, you
have no right to impose such insensibility on a mother.”</p>

<p>Robert and his father met in battle at Archembraye;
and in the contest Robert unhorsed his father, and, unconscious
as to whom he had defeated, was about to
pierce him with his sword, when he recognized his foe,
and fell at his feet begging forgiveness, horrified at the
thought of how nearly he had committed the awful crime
of parricide. A reconciliation took place, and Robert accompanied
William to England.</p>

<p>Matilda’s last years were embittered by domestic troubles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
She remained in Normandy. The death of her
daughter Constance and renewed quarrels between Robert
and his father, added to her own failing health, quickened
her decline. She died at Caen, in November, 1083.
Her husband hastened from England when informed of
her danger, and arrived as she breathed her last. She
was interred in the Church of the Holy Trinity at Caen.
William the Conqueror survived her only four years,
when his death was occasioned by an accident during the
storming of the city of Nantes, when his horse stumbled
over some burning timber, and throwing the king violently
forward in the saddle, he was so seriously injured
as to result in his death. William the Conqueror was
buried in the Church of St. Stephen at Caen. The portraits
of William and Matilda were painted upon the walls
of St. Stephen’s chapel.</p>

<p>William was remarkable for his great strength and imposing
beauty. He was a head taller than all his subjects.
The face of Queen Matilda was beautiful and delicate.
Their two sons, William Rufus and Henry, reigned successively
over England. Robert died in prison. Their
fourth daughter, Adela, was the mother of King Stephen.</p>

<p>In 1562 the Calvinist soldiers broke open the tombs of
William and Matilda, hoping to find rich treasures; but
finding nothing but a sapphire ring upon Matilda’s finger,
they rudely threw the bones carelessly around. In 1642
these relics were collected, and their tombs restored,
though at the close of the last century the French Republicans
destroyed the monumental memorial of Matilda,
which had been there erected by her husband before his
death. Thus the needle-work of Queen Matilda has
proved to be a more lasting memorial of her fame than
the costly monument of marble erected to her memory.</p>

<h2>MARGARET OF ANJOU.<br>

<small>A.D. 1429-1482.</small></h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The red rose and the white are on his face,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">The fatal colours of our striving houses.”</span></div>
<div class="sig">—<span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span></div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">ONE of the most momentous civil commotions in the
annals of English history was the famous War of
the Roses, which was waged for many years between the
Houses of Lancaster and York, during which sanguine
contests the plains of England were deluged with blood;
eighty princes were slain, and the ancient nobility were
almost entirely annihilated.</p>

<p>With these exciting incidents the name of Margaret of
Anjou is indissolubly associated, and she stands forth
in history as one of the most important participants in
that great civil struggle, which may be thus briefly stated.</p>

<p>Henry VI., the reigning king of England, was the son
of John of Gaunt, a younger son of Edward the Third.
About this time, the Duke of York, who was descended
by his mother’s side from Lionel, an older son of the same
Edward, aspired to the throne, and gathering to his
standard many powerful nobles, he sought to dethrone
King Henry.</p>

<p>The partisans of the House of York chose the white
rose for their badge, while the reigning House of Lancaster
wore, as their emblem, the red rose.</p>

<p>Previously to this period, Henry, the king of England,
had wedded Margaret of Anjou.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>This princess was the youngest daughter of René, Duke
of Anjou. Her father was the son of Louis II., king of
Naples, Sicily, and Jerusalem, and also sovereign count of
Provence, Anjou, and Maine.</p>

<p>But though Duke René was heir to so many kingdoms
at the time of his daughter’s marriage, he was owner of
none; and instead of providing her with a rich dower,
suitable to her rank, the marriage stipulations were very
peculiar.</p>

<p>Henry VI. of England was twenty-six years of age.
His country was impoverished by a thirty years’ war.
Margaret was at this time living at Naples, of which
realm her father called himself king. Amongst the
princesses selected for the approval of the bachelor king of
England, none pleased King Henry so well as the beautiful
face of Margaret of Anjou, whose portrait had been
sent to him for his examination. So overtures were at
once made to the father of this lovely princess.</p>

<p>René consented most readily to the marriage, on the
condition that the bride’s wedding portion should be only
her own lovely charms and superior accomplishments,
which he declared were worth more than all the riches of
the world.</p>

<p>But this was not all in this strange marriage agreement.
René also demanded that Henry should restore to him
his patrimonial estates of Anjou and Maine, which had
been wrested from him.</p>

<p>Though Margaret’s father possessed so many high-sounding
titles, he was in truth a royal pauper. He had
been driven out of Naples, England held Anjou and
Maine, and in order to pay his ransom to the Duke of
Burgundy, who had kept him a prisoner for six years,
René had been obliged to mortgage his other dominions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
so that now he possessed neither castle nor an acre of
ground he could call his own.</p>

<p>The Earl of Suffolk, who had been sent by King Henry
to make the marriage settlements, was alarmed to bring
back to his sovereign such an unheard-of demand from
the father of a portionless bride; but as René would not
relent, Suffolk was forced to return to his king with this
strange proposal.</p>

<p>Although King Henry was almost as much poverty-stricken
as the lovely princess, her fair face so bewitched
him that he readily consented to take her, not only without
dower, but to relinquish for her the domains of Anjou
and Maine.</p>

<p>The Earl of Suffolk was sent back to wed the fair princess
as proxy for Henry, and in St. Martin’s church, at
Nanci, in November, 1444, Margaret was married by
proxy, the bride being in her fifteenth year.</p>

<p>The ceremony was performed in the presence of her
aunt, Marie of Anjou, queen of France, and Charles VII.
The bride’s father and mother were also present, and all
the leading nobles of the courts of France and Lorraine;
the mother of the bride being Isabella, claimant of the
duchy of Lorraine.</p>

<p>At the nuptial tournaments and festivities, which lasted
for eight days, all the knights wore daisies on their helmets;
and the bridemaids and other maidens of Lorraine
were decked with wreaths and garlands of the same
flower, in honor of the bride’s name, “Marguerite,” signifying
“the daisy.”</p>

<p>During these wedding festivities, an enlivening incident
occurred. Yolante, the elder sister of Margaret, had for
a long time been betrothed to Ferry of Lorraine, the heir
of Duke Antony, the successful competitor for that dukedom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
For some reason René had delayed this marriage;
and so, at this auspicious moment, the young prince ran
away with his fiancée and married her. Charles VII.,
king of France, interceded for their pardon, which René
was only too willing to grant, as his apparent opposition
had only been on account of lack of dower for his
daughter.</p>

<p>Margaret now started on her journey to England, to
meet King Henry, to whom she had been married by
proxy. She was attended by the Marquis of Suffolk, who
had been raised to that rank by King Henry, that he
might act as his proxy; and Suffolk’s wife, the Countess
of Shrewsbury, and many other noble ladies, accompanied
the young bride on this momentous journey.</p>

<p>So poor was the fair little bride, and so poverty-stricken
was her royal husband, that she had set out with no
money and with little apparel; and her royal lord could
not forward to her a farthing, until the Parliament, in
February, 1445, granted him the half of a fifteenth on all
movables.</p>

<p>A rough bridal voyage, indeed, was vouchsafed to this
young and beautiful bride. It was five months after her
marriage by proxy before she was married to Henry with
the usual ceremonies in Tichfield Abbey. Meantime, not
only had sea-sickness brought her to a hospital, but there
she was attacked by small-pox ere she had recovered
from the effects of her voyage. This terrible disease was
fortunately very light in her case, for her marriage took
place in little more than a week after she had recovered
from the short attack.</p>

<p>It is curious to note that the doctor’s bill for attendance,
during the voyage and at the time of this sickness, was
only three pounds nine shillings and twopence; and this
for attending the royal queen of England.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret’s nuptials with Henry VI. were solemnized
April 22, 1445. The bridal ring, set with a ruby, was
made from the one with which Henry was consecrated at
the time of his coronation. The queen received a bridal
present of a lion. Her coronation took place May 30,
at Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>But scarcely was the beautiful queen seated upon her
royal throne ere troubles gathered thick and fast about
her; and she continued to be a victim to misfortune
during all the remainder of her life.</p>

<p>The Duke of Gloucester and the rich old Cardinal
Beaufort were rival statesmen of England. It had been
through Cardinal Beaufort, assisted by Suffolk, that
Henry had won the fair Margaret; whereas the Duke of
Gloucester had proposed another alliance. For this reason
the power of the cardinal was now in the ascendant
at court; and through Suffolk, who gradually obtained
uncontrolled authority, both in the council and in Parliament,
the cardinal possessed immense power over the
crown. As the king and queen were still hampered by
their impoverished condition, the rich cardinal frequently
relieved the pressing needs of the royal pair, and thus
secured greater influence over them.</p>

<p>In 1447, the mysterious death of the Duke of Gloucester
occurred, and the enemies of Beaufort and the queen
asserted that he was murdered by their connivance. But
this unjust charge is apparently without the least foundation,
as records state that the duke died from illness,
probably apoplexy.</p>

<p>During the same year the aged Cardinal Beaufort died,
and the king and queen were left without his support,
and what was equally important, the aid of his well-filled
purse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>King Henry now began to show symptoms of the fearful
brain malady which he had inherited from his grandfather,
Charles VI. Henry’s ministry, headed by Suffolk,
was despised and hated. At this time the government
fell mostly into the hands of the young queen of eighteen,
who found herself obliged to rely upon Suffolk, who became
daily more distasteful to the English people.</p>

<p>In 1448 hostilities with France were renewed, and
Charles VII. reconquered Normandy. This was the same
king of France, whose coronation at Rheims was secured
to him through the brave efforts of the Maid of Orleans,
Joan d’Arc, whose romantic story has been so often
related. Declaring that she was called by the angel
St. Michael and the virgin saints to deliver her country
from the English, she led her troops to Orleans, carrying
a marvellous sword in her hand, which she said she had
been directed to bring from the shrine of St. Catherine;
and she succeeded in delivering that city from the siege.
This victory prepared the way for the coronation of
Charles VII.; but to his eternal disgrace, when this
brave maiden was afterwards captured by her enemies,
and tried as a witch, he did not make any effort to save
her, though to her he owed his crown; and she was burnt
at the stake, in the market-place at Rouen.</p>

<p>The loss of Normandy gave great offence to the English,
who blamed Queen Margaret, derisively calling her the
“Frenchwoman”; and the partisans of the Duke of York
attributed their losses to the misgovernment of the queen,
and declared that King Henry was more fit for a cloister
than a throne, in that he had seemingly deposed himself
by leaving; his kingdom in the hands of a woman.</p>

<p>About this time Queen Margaret invested the Duke of
York with the government of Ireland. He left a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
party in England, who soon caused the Duke of Suffolk
to be impeached and arrested. In order to save his life,
the queen persuaded the king to banish Suffolk for five
years; but the ship on which he embarked was captured
by his enemies, and he was beheaded after a mock trial.</p>

<p>We cannot mention all the contests in this War of the
Roses. An insurrection headed by Jack Cade, who
called himself Mortimer, arose in Kent. This rebellion
was quickly quelled by Henry VI.; but new disasters followed.
The Duke of Somerset returned from France,
having been defeated in trying to maintain England’s
power there. Every province in France, but Calais, was
now lost to the English, and for this misfortune the people
blamed the poor young queen.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Duke of York came back from Ireland,
impeached Somerset in Parliament, and he was sent to the
Tower. At this time the badges of the red and the white
rose were adopted by the partisans of York and Lancaster.
To add to the troubles in which the poor queen was
plunged, King Henry’s malady became so great that it
could no longer be concealed, and just at this inauspicious
time the young Prince of Wales was born. York assumed
all the power of the government, and for more than a
year the king remained in total ignorance of all that was
passing around him, being in a continued state of helpless
idiocy. When the prince was about fifteen months old,
his father recovered his reason, and his first recognition
of his wife and child is thus quaintly described: “On
Monday, at noon, the queen came to him, and brought
my lord prince with her. Then the king asked, ‘What
the prince’s name was?’ and the queen told him ‘Edward’;
and then he held up his hands and thanked God
thereof. And he said he never knew him till that time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
nor wist what was said to him, nor wist where he had been
whilst he had been sick, till now. And he asked who
were the godfathers; and the queen told him, and he was
well content.”</p>

<p>Margaret took immediate measures to secure King
Henry’s restoration to sovereign power. Though he was
still very weak, the queen caused him to be conveyed to
the House of Lords, where he dissolved the Parliament,
and restored Somerset to liberty. The Duke of York,
aided by Salisbury and Warwick, now raised an army,
and drew near to London. King Henry, who hated bloodshed,
sent word to the insurgents to ask why they had
armed themselves against him. The Duke of York replied
that he would not lay down arms unless the Duke
of Somerset was delivered up to justice. This the king
refused to do, saying “he would deliver up his crown as
soon as he would the Duke of Somerset.” Whereupon
the Earl of Warwick commenced the attack. The battle
was short but bloody. Somerset was killed, and even
King Henry was himself wounded by an arrow in the
neck. But he would not stir from the scene until he was
left alone under his royal banner, when he proceeded very
coolly into a baker’s shop near by, where the Duke of
York found him, and bending the knee before him in a
sort of mock reverence, bade him rejoice that the traitor
Somerset was slain. King Henry replied: “For mercy’s
sake, stop the slaughter of my subjects!” York then
took the wounded king by the hand, and led him first to
the shrine of St. Alban, and then to his own apartments.
The next day he conducted King Henry, with seeming
respect, to London; but in reality the king was the prisoner
of the Duke of York. Henry’s distress of mind
brought on again his fits of insanity, and in this state he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
was forced to pardon York and make him Protector. The
Duke of York relinquished the care of the imbecile king
to Queen Margaret, on condition that she would retire
with the king and infant prince to Hertford Castle.</p>

<p>For two years Margaret remained in retirement; but
in February, 1456, King Henry again recovered himself
sufficiently to enter Parliament and declare himself well
enough to resume his royal authority. Parliament allowed
his claim, and York was forced to retire.</p>

<p>Again the government was put in the hands of the
friends of the queen. Again the health of the king was
impaired, but Margaret took him to Coventry, which she
called her haven of safety, on account of the favor shown
her by the inhabitants there; and at length, King Henry
having somewhat recovered, he went to London, and
there invited the Duke of York and all his partisans to a
pacification banquet and religious ceremony at St. Paul’s
cathedral, in which procession it is said that every one
walked with an enemy, from the queen down, as Margaret
was accompanied by the Duke of York to the altar,
where all swore eternal amity.</p>

<p>This amity lasted a year, when an affray broke out
amongst the king’s cooks and scullions, who soundly
whipped Warwick’s men; whereupon all parties flew to
arms, and the battle of Bloreheath, and other skirmishes,
were fought.</p>

<p>At this time the Yorkists were defeated, but again they
rallied and seized upon London.</p>

<p>The queen once more brought her sick husband to her
harbor of Coventry; and, as he regained his strength,
she rallied round the banner of the Red Rose many of
the heirs of the valiant earls who had fallen at St.
Albans, and she induced the king to leave Coventry, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
encamp with his army near Sandifford. The Lancastrians
and the Yorkists met in battle, July 9, 1460, near
Northampton. In the conflict which lasted two hours,
ten thousand Englishmen were slain, and King Henry
was taken prisoner.</p>

<p>Queen Margaret was not herself in the battle, but was
stationed with the young prince, Edward, her son, where
she could view the field and communicate with her generals.
Perceiving the disastrous result of the contest,
Margaret fled with the young prince to a castle in North
Wales.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Duke of York had taken King Henry
to London as his prisoner, and there compelled him to
sign an order, commanding Queen Margaret and the
prince to return to London under penalty of high treason;
and Henry was furthermore forced to acquiesce in
an arrangement that he should wear the crown for his
life, but that, upon his death, the Duke of York and his
heirs should succeed to the right of the throne.</p>

<p>But Margaret was not thus to be ordered by the haughty
Duke of York and his party against her royal will. When
she received this summons, she was in Scotland, seeking
aid from the Scotch king; and her brave answer was to
march with a large army against York; and she drove
him to his strong castle, where he intended to await the
coming of his son Edward, with reinforcements. But
Margaret surrounded his castle, and, by challenge and
taunts, urged him to come forth to battle. The Duke of
York, whose pride was at length stung by the defiant
taunts of a woman, gave her battle, and in the contest
he was killed.</p>

<p>One of the royalists afterwards cut off the head from
the corpse of the Duke of York, and brought this bloody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
trophy to Queen Margaret, who at first beheld it with
horror, and then laughingly said: “Put the traitor’s head
on York gate, and take care that room be left for those
of the earls of March and Warwick, which, forsooth,
shall soon keep him company.”</p>

<p>Queen Margaret now pushed on towards London, flushed
with her recent success, determined to rescue King Henry
from the power of the Yorkists. The Earl of Warwick
came out from the metropolis, bearing in his train the
royal prisoner, and met the forces of Queen Margaret on
the old battle-field of St. Albans. The Yorkists held the
town, but the royalists penetrated the streets, and a
hand-to-hand fight ensued. Warwick’s Londoners were
no match for the brave Northmen who fought for Queen
Margaret, and the Yorkists were forced to fly, leaving
King Henry sitting in his tent. Here he was found by
Queen Margaret and Prince Edward, and his brave queen
and son embraced him with joy; and King Henry
thereupon knighted the young Prince of Wales, and many
valiant Lancastrians, for their valor. But Margaret’s
triumphs did not long continue. St. Albans was won,
but not London.</p>

<p>The victorious young warrior, Edward, Earl of March,
eldest son of the late Duke of York, who now bore his
father’s title, having conquered the Lancastrians in other
contests while Margaret routed the Yorkists at St.
Albans, now entered London with all the pomp of a
triumphant king, and was received by the people with
acclamations of delight; for Margaret had injudiciously
allowed her Northern men to plunder the English, and
had therefore incurred their hatred; so that now she was
again forced to seek refuge in the North, while Edward
of York was proclaimed king, as Edward IV. In a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
time an army of sixty thousand men was raised in behalf
of Margaret, and commanded by Henry Beaufort, who
was now Duke of Somerset, and another intrepid noble,
Lord Clifford, who had killed the youngest son of the
Duke of York, and cut off the head from the dead body
of the father, in the contest between the Lancastrians
and Yorkists, when the Duke of York had been slain.
By the advice of these nobles Margaret remained with
her husband and son in the city of York; while the army
of the Red Rose went forth to battle with the forces of
the White Rose, under the banner of the young Edward
of York.</p>

<p>The Lancastrians were defeated at Ferrybridge and
Towton, and Queen Margaret then fled with King Henry
and their son to Newcastle, and from thence to Alnwick
Castle. As the Yorkists still approached, she retreated
to Scotland. At length Margaret and her son went to
France to seek aid from King Louis XI. Upon Margaret’s
promising to offer Calais as security, King Louis
lent her twenty thousand crowns, and permitted Brezé, of
Normandy, to follow her with two thousand men.</p>

<p>With this little army Margaret returned to Scotland and
rallied her Scotch adherents; and bringing King Henry
into the field, who had previously been hiding at Harleck
Castle, the brave, undaunted queen conquered the strong
fortresses of Bamborough, Alnwick, and Dunstanburgh.</p>

<p>But her triumph was of short duration. Somerset soon
after surrendered the castle of Bamborough to Warwick,
on condition that he should receive a pension from King
Edward; Suffolk and Exeter also swore homage to the
throne of Edward. But notwithstanding these treacheries,
Margaret still courageously struggled, and at length succeeded
in winning back Somerset and Exeter to the banner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
of the Red Rose; but Somerset was, after all, a poor
support, and in the contest which followed at Hexham his
weak generalship caused a total rout of the Lancastrian
army. Margaret fled with the young prince to the Scottish
border, taking with her all the jewels and treasures
she could secure; but these were all stolen from her by a
band of banditti who attacked her small company of
friends; and while the ruffians, with drawn swords, were
fighting for the plunder, Margaret escaped with her son
alone in the dense forest: here night closed over them.
They had neither of them tasted food since early in the
day. To add to her distress, poor Margaret did not know
whether her husband was dead or alive, as they had fled
from Hexham in different directions. Every tree in that
dark forest seemed to the terrified queen’s fancies an
armed foe, seeking the life of herself and child. Suddenly,
as the moon broke through the obscuring clouds, she
perceived a gigantic man advancing towards her. For a
moment her heart stood still for very horror, but with the
danger came also courage; and, filled with a sudden
inspiration of sublime action, she advanced with calm
majesty to the outlaw, leading her son by the hand, and
with the manner of a queen whose right it was to command,
and in tones thrilling with overpowering fervor, she
presented her child, saying:—</p>

<p>“Here, my friend, save the son of your king! to your
loyalty I intrust him. Take him, and conceal him from
those who seek his life. Give him refuge in thine own
hiding-place.”</p>

<p>The appeal of the brave queen was not in vain. The
outlaw, who chanced to be a ruined Lancastrian, well
remembered his much-loved queen. Right royally this
knight of the forest received his honored guests; raising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the poor tired little prince in his strong arms, he led the
way to his hidden cave. Here the royal fugitives were
refreshed and waited upon by the wife of the Lancastrian
outlaw: this retreat has since been called “Queen Margaret’s
Cave.” Here she was found three days after by
Brezé and the Duke of Exeter and other friends; and
learning from them that her husband was alive, she went
with them to Scotland; then finding no safety there, sailed
for France. Storms drove her into the dominions and
power of her father’s old foe, the Duke of Burgundy.
Although Margaret had declared in the days of her prosperity,
that if she should ever get the Duke of Burgundy
into her power, she would make the “axe pass between his
head and shoulders,” nevertheless this family foe showed
himself to be a true knight and worthy gentleman, for he
not only received her but gave her hospitality; and
though he would not listen to her entreaties in behalf of
her husband, he gave her twelve thousand crowns, and
bestowed many favors upon her companions in distress,
and forwarded her in safety to her father’s duchy of Bar.
Here for seven years Margaret, no longer a queen, except
in name, resided with her son, the prince, in her father’s
dominions, who, on account of the ruinous contests in
which he and his son were engaged with Aragon, could
offer her only an asylum. Her father René was little
fitted by nature for the severe and ferocious times in
which he lived. He was a poet, artist, and musician of
rare talent, and his chansons are still sung by his native
Provençals. At length, King Edward of England quarrelled
with the Earl of Warwick, one of the strongest
supporters of the Yorkists; and that nobleman came to
France with others of his adherents to seek the aid of
King Louis XI.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret was summoned to the French court, and it
was there arranged that she should pawn Calais to Louis
XI., and that her son Edward, who was now a youth,
should be married to the daughter of the Earl of Warwick,
the Lady Anne Nelville. Thus Warwick espoused
the cause of the Red Rose, and a new expedition was
prepared for the invasion of England. Warwick was at
first successful. King Edward fled; Henry VI. was
released from his restraint in the Tower, where he had been
held as a royal prisoner; but having been treated with
kindness, and weary of conflict, he was not overjoyed at
his restoration. Margaret prepared to go to England
with her son, the Prince of Wales, and his young bride
Anne. But furious storms again overtook her, and ere
she landed at Weymouth, her fortune had again forsaken
her. When the dreadful news reached her of the death
of Warwick and recapture of King Henry, she fell in a
swoon, and upon regaining consciousness, refused for a
long time to be comforted. At length she was visited by
Lancastrian nobles, who persuaded her to again unfurl the
banner of the Red Rose.</p>

<p>At Tewkesbury the fatal battle was fought which laid
the Red Rose in the dust. Upon this battle-field the last
hope of the unfortunate queen perished forever. The
brave young Prince of Wales was taken prisoner; and being
brought into the presence of King Edward, the monarch,
impressed with the noble bearing of the youth,
inquired “how he durst so presumptuously enter his
realms, with banners displayed against him?” to which
the prince, with more courage than policy, boldly replied,
“To recover my father’s crown and mine own inheritance.”
Stung into sudden anger, King Edward struck the intrepid
prince in the face with his gauntlet, which was the signal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
for the cruel men around him to pierce his brave young
heart with their sharp daggers. The following day Queen
Margaret was brought a prisoner to King Edward, by her
old enemy, Sir William Stanley, who had just revealed
the terrible fate of her son to the anguished mother, with
brutal coldness and abruptness. Smarting under this
awful blow, Margaret invoked terrible maledictions upon
the head of King Edward; and this same enemy took very
good care to repeat these rash words which had escaped
the agonized heart of the distracted mother to his royal
master, who was so exasperated that he at first determined
to put her to death; but as no Plantagenet had shed the
blood of woman, he feared to do this bloody deed, and
ordered her to be imprisoned in the Tower of London.
The same night upon which Margaret of Anjou was placed
within its gloomy walls, her husband, whom she had not
met for seven long years, was dragged from his cell in the
same prison and put to death. At first the imprisonment
of Margaret was very rigorous; but through the intercession
of King Edward’s wife, Elizabeth of Woodville, who
had been one of the ladies in waiting at Queen Margaret’s
court, the poor heart-broken sufferer was released from such
strict confinement; and at length her impoverished father
came to her partial relief, and by sacrificing his inheritance
of Provence, he succeeded in securing her release
from imprisonment, she having signed a formal renunciation
of all the rights her marriage in England had given
her.</p>

<p>But this poor faded Red Rose had one more trial to
bear. A dry leprosy now attacked the once beautiful
Margaret of Anjou, and transformed the lovely “Marguerite,”
whose beauty had been celebrated throughout
the world, into a loathsome spectacle of horror. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
nearly six years she endured a living death in the castles
provided by her father for her retreat, until, in 1482, the
welcome summons came. She was buried in the cathedral
of Angers, and her only memorial was her portrait on
glass in a window of the cathedral, which had been painted
by her father twenty years before. Maria Louisa, the
second wife of Napoleon I., possessed the breviary once
owned by Margaret of Anjou: in it was written, “<i>Vanite
des vanites, tout la vanite!</i>” Surely a fitting epitaph for
the once beautiful, powerful, lovely Margaret of Anjou,
queen of England; but alas! afterwards, the fallen,
faded, hapless Red Rose of English history.</p>

<p>Among the warm partisans of the Lancastrian cause,
was John Grey, afterwards Lord Ferrers, whose wife
was the beautiful Elizabeth Woodville, maid of honor at
the court of Queen Margaret.</p>

<p>Lord Ferrers lost his life in the War of the Roses; and
his widow, the beautiful Lady Grey, afterwards married
Edward, son of the renowned Duke of York, the champion
of the White Rose.</p>

<p>By this marriage of the Roses, which occurred after
Edward had become king of England, as Edward IV.,
this famous War of the Roses ended in a match of hearts.</p>

<h2>CATHARINE OF ARAGON.<br>

<small>A.D. 1485-1536.</small></h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 4em;">“By my troth,</span></div>
<div class="verse">I would not be a queen!</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 7em;">Verily,</span></div>
<div class="verse">I swear, ’tis better to be lowly born,</div>
<div class="verse">And range with humble livers in content,</div>
<div class="verse">Than to be perk’d up in a glistering grief,</div>
<div class="verse">And wear a golden sorrow.”—<span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span></div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">BEAUTIFUL Granada rose like an enchanted city in
the midst of the blooming plain, where flourished
the citron and the pomegranate, the latter of which gave
to the city its euphonious name. Olive groves and vineyards
clustered around it and fig-trees hung heavy with
their purplish fruit; while orange and lemon groves bent
’neath the rich burden of golden spheres of luscious nectar,
intermingled with the snowy blossoms which, half
hidden amongst the dark green foliage, filled the air with
such exquisite perfume as to make one dream of the ambrosial
fields of Paradise. To the north, towered mountains
whose lofty, snow-crowned summits seemed to pierce
the blue heavens above, and other ranges guarded it on
the east and south, while the blue waters of the Mediterranean
washed its western shores, and brought trade and
commerce to this fair Eden of sunny Spain.</p>

<p>And as picturesque as was this lovely setting, equally
picturesque was the quaint and fascinating city, with its
gorgeous Alhambra, whose shining turrets loomed high
above the surrounding buildings and its spacious courts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
adorned by graceful columns and spanned by arched ceilings
glowing with varied colors and ornate with quaint
design, while through its many corridors Moorish cavaliers
and dark-eyed beauties, attired in their picturesque
costumes, passed in a fascinating procession and lent the
charm of life to this weird scene.</p>

<p>But war had invaded this fair realm. For long years it
had been besieged by hostile hosts, who strove to drive the
Moors from their enchanting dominions. Already the
city of Santa Fé had arisen, as though by magic, around
the besieged city of Granada, and Ferdinand and Isabella
of Spain at length entered the gorgeous Alhambra as
conquerors, and the last sigh of the departing Moors
echoed amid the fragrant orange groves, in a ghostly wail
of hopeless despair.</p>

<p>It was on the 6th of January, 1492, that Isabella and
Ferdinand made their triumphal entry into the conquered
city, and the standard of the Cross and the banner of
Castile were seen floating together on the lofty watch-tower
of the glorious palace of the Alhambra. Upon this
momentous occasion, the little Catharine of Aragon, then
seven years of age, accompanied her parents and sister in
the imposing procession.</p>

<p>This pretty Spanish princess had first opened her eyes
upon this world at the small town called Alcala des Henares,
while Isabella, her mother, was journeying to spend
Christmas at Toledo, then the capital of Spain.</p>

<p>Her infant days were spent in camps of war, for the
illustrious Isabella accompanied her husband Ferdinand
upon all his expeditions, and by her presence and counsel
inspired the Christian soldiers to those deeds of valor
which gained the victory over the Moors.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 453px;">
<img src="./girlsBooksFamousQueens_files/i-152.jpg" width="453" height="598" alt="Catherine looking sad">
<div class="caption">QUEEN CATHARINE.</div>
</div>

<p>It was this same Isabella of Castile, who first instituted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
regular military surgeons, to attend the sick in the armies
and be at hand on the field of battle to care for the
wounded. These surgeons were paid out of her own revenues;
and she also provided spacious tents, furnished
with beds and all things requisite for the sick and
wounded, which were called the “Queen’s Hospital.”</p>

<p>Thus, to the compassionate heart of the famous Isabella
of Castile, the world is indebted for the first army
hospital, which institution has since proved such a blessing
to mankind, in the saving of innumerable lives, and in
some slight measure alleviating a part of the frightful
evils of war.</p>

<p>After the fall of Granada, Ferdinand and Isabella took
up their residence in the magnificent Alhambra, and it was
in this fascinating place that the childhood of Catharine of
Aragon was passed.</p>

<p>It was from Granada, this fairy-land of her youthful
memories, that Catharine derived her device of the pomegranate.
The pomegranate was the royal insignia of the
Moorish kings. The motto afterwards adopted by Queen
Catharine, “<i>Not for my crown</i>,” was also derived from the
same source; for the crown of the pomegranate is worthless
and is always thrown away.</p>

<p>What strange contrast in the two pictures portrayed in
the life of Catharine by the unforeseen vicissitudes of fortune.
The blooming maiden, filled with ecstatic pleasure
by the alluring fascinations of the matchless scenes around
her, now wandering with childish curiosity through the
glowing courts of the glorious Alhambra, or enjoying the
sylvan retreats amidst the orange and citron groves, or
seeking the cool shade of the pomegranate trees, presents
a very different picture to the neglected queen of England,
cruelly banished by her atrocious husband, to die in loneliness
and even penury.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Princess Catharine was nine years of age, she
was betrothed to Arthur, Prince of Wales, eldest son of
Elizabeth of York and Henry VII.</p>

<p>The correspondence of these youthful lovers was carried
on in Latin, that they might improve themselves in that
language.</p>

<p>In 1501, Catharine embarked with her Spanish governess
and four young court ladies, attended by a train of
lords and ecclesiastics, to go to England to be united in
marriage to Prince Arthur. The marriage was celebrated
Nov. 14, 1501.</p>

<p>Catharine’s bridal costume was a great surprise to the
English ladies. The Spanish princess and her ladies had
previously astonished the English populace, when, according
to an English fashion, they made their equestrian
public entry into London. The large round hats worn by
Catharine and her <i>donnas</i> upon that occasion had created
much comment.</p>

<p>“At her bridal Catharine wore upon her head a coif of
white silk, with a scarf bordered with gold and pearls
and precious stones, five inches and a half broad, which
veiled the greater part of her visage and her person.
This was the celebrated Spanish mantilla. Her gown was
very large; both the sleeves and also the body had many
plaits, and beneath the waist certain round hoops, bearing
out the gown from the waist downward. Such was
the first arrival of the farthingale in England, revived at
times as hoop petticoats and crinolines. In the elaborate
pageantry the princely pair were very prettily allegorized,
she as ‘My Lady Hesperus,’ and he as ‘The Star Arcturus,’
from which the Celtic name of Arthur is derived.”</p>

<p>The old chronicles thus describe the gorgeous marriage
ceremony:—<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“Within the church of St. Paul’s was erected a platform
or stage, six feet high, and extending from the west
door to the uppermost step of the choir; in the middle of
this platform was a high stand like a mountain, which was
ascended on every side with steps covered over with red
worsted.</p>

<p>“Against this mountain on the north side was ordained
a standing for the king and his friends; and upon the
south side was erected another standing, which was occupied
by the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of London.</p>

<p>“Then, upon the fourteenth of November, being Sunday,
Prince Arthur and the Infanta Catharine, both clad
in white satin, ascended the mountain, one on the north
and the other on the south side, and were there married by
the Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by nineteen bishops
and abbots. The king and the queen and the king’s
mother stood in the place aforenamed, where they heard
and beheld the solemnization, which, being finished, the
archbishop and bishops took their way from the mountain
across the platform, which was covered under foot with
blue ray cloth, into the choir, and so to the high altar.
The prelates were followed by the bride and bridegroom.
The Princess Cecily bore the train of the bride, and after
her followed one hundred ladies and gentlewomen in
right costly apparel. Then the Mayor, in a gown of crimson
velvet, and his brethren in scarlet, went and sat in the
choir whilst mass was said. The Archbishop of York sat
in the dean’s place and made the chief offering, and after
him came the Duke of Buckingham. The mass being
finished, Arthur publicly dowered his bride, at the church
door, with one-third of his income as Prince of Wales;
and afterwards the prince and princess were conducted in
grand procession out of church into the bishop’s palace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
where a grand feast was prepared, to which the Lord
Mayor and Aldermen were invited.</p>

<p>“The city functionaries were served with plate valued
at one thousand two hundred pounds, but the plate off
which the princess dined was of solid gold, ornamented
with pearls and precious stones, and worth twenty thousand
pounds.</p>

<p>“It was wonderful to behold the costly apparel and the
massive chains of gold worn on that day. Sir Thomas
Brandon, the master of the king’s horse, wore a gold
chain, valued at one thousand four hundred pounds.
Rivers, the master of the king’s hawks, wore a chain
worth one thousand pounds, and many of the other chains
worn were worth from two to three hundred pounds each.
The Duke of Buckingham wore a robe of the most beautiful
needle-work, wrought upon cloth of gold tissue and
furred with sable, worth one thousand five hundred
pounds; and Sir Nicholas Vaux wore a gown of purple
velvet, so thickly ornamented with pieces of massive gold
that the gold alone, independent of the silk and fur, was
worth one thousand pounds.”</p>

<p>In honor of this marriage, tournaments, and festivals,
and most gorgeous pageants, followed by banquets and
grand balls, were celebrated for many days.</p>

<p>But clouds soon gathered around Catharine. In about
four months after the marriage, while Prince Arthur and
Catharine were residing at the Castle of Ludlow, in Wales,
the young prince sickened and died; and the poor young
princess was left a widow in a strange land. Catharine
was now escorted back to London, where she was received
with kindness by Queen Elizabeth, her mother-in-law.
But the kind queen died in two years and Catharine’s
troubles began regarding her great dower. Her father,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Ferdinand of Spain, had promised to give as a marriage
settlement two hundred thousand crowns. Only one instalment
of this had been paid, and until the whole amount
was received, Henry VII. refused to allow his daughter-in-law
the revenue Arthur had given her as her marriage gift.</p>

<p>And now began intrigues and quarrels over this poor
little widow of sixteen. First King Henry VII. determined
to marry her himself, but this proposal Catharine would
not accept. Next it was proposed to marry her to the
king’s son Henry, now become Prince of Wales. As this
proposition was not refused by Ferdinand and Isabella of
Spain, the helpless young stranger was obliged to submit,
and as her father would not pay her dower until the matter
was settled, and as her father-in-law would not allow
her the revenue from her late young husband, the poor
little princess was reduced to great extremities. She
needed clothes, she had no means of paying her servants,
and neither king seemed to have pity upon her. Her
mother, Isabella of Spain, sympathized deeply with the
sorrows of her child, but she was now dying and could do
little to help her.</p>

<p>At length it was decided that Catharine, now nineteen
years of age, should be betrothed to Henry, who was then
fourteen. But before this marriage was consummated,
Isabella of Spain had breathed her last. Well for her
mother-heart that she did not know the terrible trials in
store for her beloved child, consequent upon this unfortunate
marriage!</p>

<p>The death of King Henry VII. in 1509, prevented all
display upon the occasion of this second marriage of Catharine
of Aragon, which occurred at Greenwich Palace,
June 11, 1509, just three months after the death of
Henry VII. From various records it is evident that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Henry VIII. loved his wife Catharine quite devotedly at
this time. In his letter to his bride’s father he wrote,
“that if Catharine and he were still free, he would choose
her for his wife before all other women.”</p>

<p>The long-disputed marriage portion was now paid by
Ferdinand of Spain, and Queen Catharine, in writing
to him, tells of her joy in at last being able to pay
her ladies their salaries which had been so long due. In
1510, a prince was born, but he lived but a few days,
much to the sorrow of King Henry and Queen Catharine.
Another baby prince also died before the birth of the
Princess Mary, in 1516.</p>

<p>“The reign of Henry VIII. is characterized by three
great movements, which have all left a profound impression
upon the destinies of England: the religious reform;
the establishment of the absolute power of the crown in
principle and often in practice; the social and even political
progress of the nation, notwithstanding great outbursts
of tyranny on the part of the government, and of servility
on the part of the people. The history of this reign is
naturally divided into two periods: Henry VIII. under
the influence of Wolsey, his favorite and soon his prime
minister; Henry VIII. alone, after the disgrace and death
of Wolsey.”</p>

<p>Of course, regarding this political aspect of this epoch
in history, we can make little or no mention in this short
sketch of Catharine of Aragon.</p>

<p>Wolsey, “the Ipswich butcher’s son, the politician
priest,” became the chief favorite of Henry and Catharine,
although, after he had been the means of securing
the execution of the queen’s friend, Buckingham, Catharine

<p>We must not pass over the meeting of the French and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
English sovereigns upon the famous “Field of the Cloth
of Gold.” This occurred in 1520, at Ardres, a small
town near Calais. A very magnificently decorated palace
had been prepared for the English king. It was built of
wood, and adorned with gigantic figures, representing
savages armed with spears and arrows, bearing Henry’s
device, “<i>Cui adhaereo praestat</i>” (He whom I support
prevails).</p>

<p>Fountains of red and white wine played constantly
before this sumptuous abode of the English king, which
was adorned with costly tapestries and magnificent gold
and silver plate.</p>

<p>A gorgeous tent of cloth of gold had been prepared
for the meeting of the two sovereigns. It was ornamented
with blue velvet studded with stars, fastened
with silken cords mixed with Cyprian gold. Into this
glistening pavilion the two kings walked arm in arm;
and thereupon began a round of feasting, drinking, music,
dancing, and amusements, which lasted a fortnight. The
extravagant splendor of this occasion has become renowned;
and, in the midst of all these licentious revelries,
Cardinal Wolsey celebrated high mass with imposing
pageantry. It is recorded that it took years
for the estates of many a nobleman to recover from the
loans contracted to make a good appearance upon this
famous Field of the Cloth of Gold.</p>

<p>In 1521 Henry VIII. determined to defend the Catholic
faith against the attacks of Martin Luther. King
Henry had no other weapon to use against the monk
except his pen. Whereupon Henry published “A Defence
of the Seven Sacraments against Martin Luther.” This
was gorgeously bound, and presented with much ceremony
to Pope Leo X. Thereupon the royal author received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
the title, from the holy father, of “Defender of the
Faith,” of which title the royal hypocrite made strange
use afterwards. Meanwhile, the haughty Cardinal Wolsey
became more arrogant and overbearing. Having the
royal ear, even princes and nobles fawned upon him in
menial attentions, and high titled lords served the pompous
cardinal on their knees, and deemed it a privilege
to do his august bidding. But Wolsey’s fall was soon to
come, and would be as direful as his power was now
ascendant.</p>

<p>In 1522 the beautiful Anne Boleyn was recalled from
France to England, and became one of Queen Catharine’s
maids of honor. From this time troubles fell thick and
heavy upon the poor queen, who was herself a faithful
wife and loving mother, and was, moreover, self-denying
and devout. And, strange as it may appear, up to this
time, such had been the life of King Henry and Queen
Catharine that they had become famous as a pattern
couple; and the celebrated Erasmus had said of them:
“What household is there, among the subjects of their
realms, that can offer an example of such united wedlock?
Where can a wife be found better matched with
the best of husbands?”</p>

<p>We can hardly imagine the atrocious Henry VIII. ever
to have been worthy of such commendation. After being
married for seventeen years to his devoted Catharine,
this prince of hypocrites is all at once troubled with most
grievous qualms of conscience. For seven years he had
been flirting with the pretty Anne Boleyn; even from the
momentous time when he had noticed her dancing at the
festivals attending the celebrated occasion of the Field of
the Cloth of Gold. But not until 1527 did this conscience-troubled
king declare publicly his very serious doubts as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
to the validity of his marriage with Catharine, who had
been previously married to his elder brother Arthur.
His pretended scruples were now confided to Cardinal
Wolsey, who advised the king to sue for a divorce.
This welcome advice the royal hypocrite most sanctimoniously
declared to be most <i>bitter</i> for him to follow,
but nevertheless, for his conscience’ sake, he was ready to
make this enormous sacrifice.</p>

<p>The famous divorce court at Blackfriars was not held
until June 18, 1529. But the conscience-stricken, atrocious
dissembler meanwhile used his utmost influence in
church and state to force priests and people to confirm
his royal pretended scruples; and earls, bishops, cardinals,
and popes, were called upon to confirm and applaud his
most holy zeal, in thus sacrificing his supposed heart’s
ease for the ease of his terribly burdened conscience.
Meanwhile, the poor, neglected, faithful wife was openly
and shamelessly discarded for the smiles of the new
beauty, who had ensnared the fancy of this most atrocious
of religious humbugs.</p>

<p>To allay somewhat the fretful anxieties consequent
upon the long delay required to bring right-minded men
to second his infamous designs, the royal author found
solace in his literary occupations, hurling anathemas
against the undaunted Luther, ostensibly in defence of
that Church whose Pope he wished to influence in favor
of his own guilty schemes; but soon this apparently
zealous defender of the Romish Church was uncloaked,
and he defied even the Pope himself, who dared to
denounce his infamous divorce.</p>

<p>We cannot give in detail these stirring but disgraceful
scenes. Poor Catharine, a stranger in a strange land,
having lost both father and mother, had none to defend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
her against the calumnies which her inhuman husband
sought to fasten upon her, but which her blameless life
rendered utterly harmless.</p>

<p>King Henry VIII. had taken very good care to make
very specious excuses for the divorce. As six children
had been born and none had lived beyond infancy,
except the Princess Mary, he declared that he found
proof of the wrath of God in these bereavements, because
he had married his brother’s widow. And this prince of
dissemblers declared in a great meeting of his nobles,
councillors, and judges, whom he had assembled in the
great chamber of his palace at Bridewell, that, “As
touching the queen, if it be adjudged by the law of God
that she is my lawful wife, there was never anything
more acceptable to me in my life, both for the discharge
of my conscience and also for her sake; for I assure
you all that, apart from her noble parentage, she is a
woman of great virtue, gentleness, and humility. Of all
good qualities appertaining to nobility, she is without
comparison; and if I were to marry again, presuming
the marriage to be good, I would choose her before all
other women.” And yet this same ostentatious pattern
of perfection and hypocritical religious cant afterwards
beheaded the illustrious Sir Thomas More, because he
would not sanction the infamous repudiation of the faithful
Catharine. And this same pretended Defender of
the Church, even though the Pope was hurling from the
Vatican his spiritual thunders of excommunication for
the sin of renouncing the devoted and blameless Queen
Catharine, defiantly married Anne Boleyn, even before
the divorce had been fully consummated.</p>

<p>In 1529 Queen Catharine was summoned into court
to meet her public sentence. When the crier called,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
“Henry, king of England, come into court,” he answered
from his royal seat of state, in loud tones,
“Here,” and thereupon proceeded to make known his
many troubles regarding his tender conscience and religious
scruples, which so sore distressed his royal mind;
ending in a panegyric upon the many virtues of his
beloved wife, Catharine, from whom none other cause
than his afflicted conscience would ever have forced him
to consent to part.</p>

<p>After this arch-traitor to all domestic faithfulness had
thus relieved his burdened heart, the crier summoned,
“Catharine, queen of England.” Taking no notice of
the surrounding legates, the sorrowful queen rose with
graceful dignity, and, followed by her ladies, she went
round about the court, even to where the king sat, and
kneeling at his feet she thus pathetically addressed him,
with quaint foreign accent and persuasive voice: “Sir, I
beseech you, for the love of God, let me have some
justice. Take some pity on me, a poor stranger in your
dominions; I have no counsellor in this land, and, as you
are the head of justice in your realm, I flee to you.
Alas! I take God to witness that for these twenty years
I have been to you a true, humble, and obedient wife.
And if our children have died, it has not been for the
want of a mother’s love or care. The king, your father,
was accounted a second Solomon for wisdom, and my
father, Ferdinand, was deemed one of the wisest kings
of Spain; and they had counsellors as wise as those of
these days, and they all, verily, thought our marriage
good and lawful. Therefore I marvel greatly at the
inventions now brought against me. If you have found
any dishonor in my conduct, then am I content to depart;
but if none there be, then I beseech you thus humbly to
let me remain in my proper state.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>The queen then rose up in tears, and making a low
obeisance to the king, she walked out of court; nor
would she return, even though the crier again called her
name. Nor would she ever more attend these evil councils,
but waited in patient silence the coming of her dread
doom. Nor did she display any enmity to the boastful
Anne Boleyn, who did most indecently declare her growing
power over the fickle fancies of the cruel king. Save
only on one occasion, did Queen Catharine give to her
intimation that she was aware of her ambitious views.
The queen was once playing cards with Anne Boleyn,
when she thus addressed her: “My lady Anne, you have
the good hap ever to stop at a king; but you are like
others, you will have all or none.”</p>

<p>At length, as Queen Catharine would not again appear
in court, although several times summoned by the loud
voice of the crier, King Henry, in his rage, sent Cardinal
Wolsey and others to the queen, to have a private
interview with her. Catharine was engaged with her
ladies in needlework at the time, to while away her
tedious hours, for the cruel king had removed the Princess
Mary from her mother, nor would any tears avail the
lonely, neglected wife, though she wrote most tender
letters to the king begging him to let her behold her child.
As the prelates entered the apartment where Queen Catharine
and her ladies were occupied with their embroidery,
the queen rose to meet them, having a skein of white silk
around her neck, and apologizing for the manner of their
unceremonious reception. “You see,” said Catharine,
pointing to the skein of silk, “our humble employment
with my maids; and yet, save these, I have no other
counsellors in England, and those in Spain on whom I
could rely are far away.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“If it please your Grace,” replied Wolsey, “we would
speak with you alone.”</p>

<p>“My lord,” answered the queen, with a proud innocence,
“if you have anything to say, speak it openly
before these folk; I would all the world should see and
hear it.”</p>

<p>Whereupon Wolsey began to address her in Latin, in
which language she was well skilled; but she said humbly:
“Pray, my good lord, speak to me in English, for
I can, thank God, understand English, though I <i>do</i> know
some Latin.”</p>

<p>The queen then led the cardinals into her withdrawing-room,
and it is recorded of this conference, that she did
so set forth her cause that they would not henceforth
decide against her.</p>

<p>But chafing at the long pontifical delays, King Henry
determined to take the matter into his own hands. He
had used every device to induce the queen to consent
to the divorce; and had by bribes and threats obtained
from most of the universities of Europe opinions that the
marriage was illegal.</p>

<p>King Henry then sent a message to Queen Catharine,
who was at that time residing at Greenwich Palace,
entreating her, for the quieting of his conscience, that she
would refer the matter to arbitration. Catharine replied:
“God grant my husband a quiet conscience; but I mean
to abide by no decision excepting that of Rome.”</p>

<p>This answer so enraged the king that he took the queen
to Windsor Castle, and then himself departing on some
excuse, he sent authoritative commands to her that she
should leave forever the royal palace.</p>

<p>“He is my husband, and it is my duty to obey him,”
said the injured and faithful wife; “but though I go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
hence at his bidding, I am his wife, and for him will I
pray.”</p>

<p>King Henry had previously endeavored to have Catharine
persuaded to enter a convent; and in view of such
an event, his sensitive conscience had required him to
apply to the ablest canonists in Rome to give him their
opinions on the three following questions: 1. Whether, if
a wife were to enter a convent, the Pope could not, in the
plenitude of his power, authorize the husband to marry
again. 2. Whether, if the husband were to enter a religious
order that he might induce his wife to do the same,
he might not be afterwards released from his vow and at
liberty to marry. 3. Whether, for reasons of state, the
Pope could not license a king to have, like the ancient
patriarchs, two wives, of whom one only should be
acknowledged and enjoy the honors of royalty. Rather
convincing proofs, truly, that the compunctions of conscience
of this royal hypocrite were a hollow sham!</p>

<p>After her expulsion from her husband’s court, Catharine
first went to her manor of the More, in Hertfordshire;
and then settled at Ampthill, from whence she
wrote to Pope Clement, informing him of her banishment
from the royal court. As the Pope would not sanction
the divorce, but instead issued a bull of excommunication
against the royal rebel, the king, in 1533, dissolved his
own wedlock by a decision pronounced in a court held by
Archbishop Cranmer. Some historians state that he had
married Anne Boleyn previously to the time when the
divorce was pronounced.</p>

<p>When the news of this double insult reached poor Catharine,
she was lying upon a sick-bed, worn out with sorrow.
In vain had she pleaded to be allowed to see her only
child, the Princess Mary, for one last farewell. And now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
her agonized mother’s heart is wrung with added woe.
Lord Montjoy, her former page, was deputed to bear to
her the minutes of the infamous conference, by whose
decision she was degraded from the rank of queen of England
to that of dowager-princess of Wales.</p>

<p>Rising from her couch and seizing her pen, she drew
it through the words “princess-dowager,” and exclaimed
to those who had brought to her this insulting document:
“So I return the minutes; and I desire ye to say to his
Grace, my husband, Catharine, his faithful consort, is his
lawful queen; and for no earthly consideration will she
consent to be called out of her name.”</p>

<p>Catharine afterwards removed to the Bishop of Lincoln’s
palace of Bungen. By the king’s orders, she was deprived
of most of her servants, because she would be waited on
by no one who did not address her as queen. She was
next removed to Kimbolton Castle, though Henry’s first
orders had been to take her to Fotheringay Castle, a
place notorious for its bad air. But Catharine had declared
that she would not go there “unless drawn with
ropes,” and so she had been sent to Kimbolton.</p>

<p>King Henry also withheld her income, due from her
jointure as Arthur’s widow; and notwithstanding the
noble portion which she had brought as her dower, she
was allowed to suffer for the very necessaries of life, and
even a new gown was obtained on trust, as her will shows.
When one of her servants, in a rage at her inhuman treatment,
execrated the perfidious Anne, Catharine gently
chided her, saying: “Hold, hold! curse her not, for in a
short time you will have good reason to pity her!”</p>

<p>As death rapidly approached the heart-broken Catharine,
she welcomed the summons as a joyful release from
her earthly unutterable woe. A few days before she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
expired, she dictated the following touching words to the
base husband who had so atrociously wronged her.</p>

<p>“My Lord and Dear Husband: I commend me unto
you. The hour of my death draweth fast on, and my case
being such, the tender love I owe you forceth me with a
few words, to put you in remembrance of the health and
safeguard of your soul, which you ought to prefer before
all worldly matters, and before the care and tendering of
your own body, for which you have cast me into many
miseries and yourself into many cares. For my part I do
pardon you all, yea, I do wish and devoutly pray God
that He will also pardon you. For the rest I commend
unto you Mary, our daughter, beseeching you to be a
good father unto her, as I heretofore desired. I entreat
you also on behalf of my maids, to give them marriage
portions which is not much, they being but three. For
all my other servants I solicit a year’s pay more than
their due, lest they should be unprovided for. Lastly do
I vow that mine eyes desire you above all things.”</p>

<p>Catharine of Aragon breathed her last Jan. 7, 1536.
Although it was said that King Henry shed tears over her
last pathetic letter, which he received a short time before
her death, yet it is also stated that he sent his lawyer to
endeavor to seize upon her little property and try to
escape paying her trifling legacies and debts.</p>

<p>On the day of her burial, King Henry wore mourning,
but Anne Boleyn clothed herself and all her ladies in
yellow, exclaiming, “Now am I queen! I am grieved,
not that she is dead, but for the vaunting of the good end
she made.”</p>

<p>Neither King Henry’s arrogant power nor Anne Boleyn’s
pernicious influence could prevent the widespread and
lasting effect of the Christian death-bed of Catharine. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
length some dared to suggest to King Henry, “that it
would become his greatness to rear a stately monument to
her memory,” whereupon the beautiful abbey-church of
Peterborough, where her remains were placed, was spared
from destruction at the period of the suppression of the
monasteries, and was endowed and established as the see
of Peterborough.</p>

<p>The life of the woman who had supplanted her was
short and full of sorrow. Three years only elapsed after
Henry had married Anne Boleyn, and only four months
after Catharine had sent him her dying forgiveness, when
her exulting rival met her awful doom.</p>

<p>Already had King Henry cast his eyes upon Jane Seymour,
and on the 15th of May, 1536, the sentence upon
the queen was pronounced. Wolsey, who had suggested
and aided the divorce of Catharine, had fallen under the
disfavor of Anne, and through her influence he was overthrown
and died in disgrace. And now Anne herself was
to suffer the penalty of her wicked ambition. On the 19th
of May, 1536, Anne Boleyn was led out upon Tower
Green, and a blow from the executioner ended her eventful,
but brief life.</p>

<p>“It is done!” cried the inhuman Henry, as he heard
the cannon which was the signal that the tragedy was
over; “that is an end of the matter. Unleash the dogs,
and let us follow the stag.”</p>

<p>Thus ended the life of Anne Boleyn, and on the next
day King Henry VIII. was married to his third wife, Jane
Seymour.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">THE lives of Queen Elizabeth, and Mary, Queen of
Scots, are so intimately associated, that a sketch of
one includes that of the other; and in order to give the
history of that epoch with greater conciseness and clearness
without unnecessary repetition, a brief outline of
each of their lives is here sketched.</p>

<p>For the sake of perspicuity, a few lines will be given to
intervening events.</p>

<p>As we stated in the account of Catharine of Aragon,
Henry VIII. married Jane Seymour upon the day following
the execution of Anne Boleyn. Fortunately for Jane
Seymour, death removed her during the succeeding year,
rather than the fatal axe of her royal husband. She left
an infant prince, who afterwards reigned a few short years
as Edward VI.</p>

<div class="attrib2">Painting by Frd. Zucchero, “so-called Ermine portrait,”
in the possession of the Marquis of Salisbury,
Hatfield House.</div>
</div>

<p>In 1540 Henry VIII. married his fourth wife, Anne of
Cleves. She had been represented as a great beauty by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
Cromwell, whom the king had raised to power. This
Cromwell was a former servant of Cardinal Wolsey. But
so great was Henry’s disgust upon beholding the awkward,
ill-dressed, ill-featured, German princess, whom he had
been inveigled into making his fourth bride, that though
the marriage was perforce celebrated according to agreement,
the unfortunate Cromwell was soon after disgraced
and executed, and the sensitive conscience of the royal
hypocrite was once again called into requisition to annul
this ill-starred union. The beautiful face of Lady Catharine
Howard no doubt quickened the stings of the conveniently
tender conscience of this dissembling King of
Knaves, who declared with pious cant that, having ascertained
that Anne of Cleves had previously been betrothed
to the Duke of Lorraine, his punctilious scruples would
not allow him to retain her as his wife; whereupon King
Henry, who waited not now for pope or bishop to annul
his marriage vows and break his conjugal fetters, bestowed
upon his divorced wife the title of “Adopted
Sister,” which honor poor Anne of Cleves consented to
receive, doubtless thanking heaven for having preserved
her from the more terrible fate of some of the wives of
this fickle consort.</p>

<p>By way of celebrating his fifth nuptials, King Henry
sent to the stake Dr. Barnes and other heretics, while
certain Catholics were quartered for having refused to
take the oath of supremacy. This persecution of both
parties occasioned the indignation of both Catholics and
Protestants. “How do folks manage to live here?” exclaimed
a Frenchman, in surprise at such fickle punishments.
“The Papists are hanged, and the anti-Papists
are burned,” was the answer.</p>

<p>But Catharine Howard had not been queen of England<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
one year before her terrible doom overshadowed her. The
king discovered certain condemnatory circumstances
regarding the conduct of the queen previous to her marriage
with him, and in a few short months Catharine also
expiated her ambition and her supposed guilt upon the
scaffold.</p>

<p>King Henry again resorted to his literary pursuits for
solace, being for the time disgusted with his experiments
in the matrimonial line, as before his hapless wives had
also been, and forsooth with graver cause and better
reason. “The king had better marry a widow,” said the
people; and that idea seeming to have occurred also to
the mind of his august majesty, in the year 1543, this
“royal Bluebeard of English history” took for his sixth
wife, the Lady Catherine Parr, the three months’ widow
of Lord Latimer. She was an ardent partisan of the
Protestant party, as well as learned and beautiful, but her
skill in argument had well-nigh cost her dear.</p>

<p>To amuse her gouty, quarrelsome, would-be-literary and
spasmodically-religious royal spouse, Queen Catherine
ventured to argue with him upon certain points in theology.
Finding himself worsted in the mental contest, the irate
king exclaimed: “A good hearing this, when women become
such clerks; and a thing much to my comfort to
come in my old age to be taught by my wife.” And
thereupon the new chancellor received the order to prepare
the impeachment of the queen. But Catherine was
warned in time of her coming doom and was possessed of
self-control and tact sufficient for this emergency. When
again the conversation turned upon religious subjects and
the king questioned her upon some knotty point, she
answered laughing: “I am not so foolish as not to know
what I can understand when I possess the favor of having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
for a master and spouse a prince so learned in holy
matters.”</p>

<p>“By St. Mary!” exclaimed the king; “it is not so,
Kate; thou hast become a doctor.”</p>

<p>“And surely,” quoth the queen with mirthful looks, “I
thought I noticed that such conversation diverted your
Grace’s attention from your sufferings, and I ventured to
discuss with you in the hope of making you forget your
present infirmity.”</p>

<p>“Is it so, sweetheart?” replied the king; “then we are
friends again, and it doth me more good than if I had
received a hundred thousand pounds.”</p>

<p>The skilful and politic queen, well pleased to find her
lovely head still resting on her own shoulders instead of
on the executioner’s block, gave thanks to God for her
deliverance, and henceforth left theology in peace. The
orders given to the chancellor not having been revoked,
the next day he arrived with forty men to arrest the
queen, but King Henry, feigning surprise and anger, sent
him away with much apparent displeasure.</p>

<p>Thus had Queen Catherine’s wit saved her neck, and
the strong grip of the increasing gout now came to her
rescue, and this Prince of Shams soon found himself held
in the clutch of such a sturdy foe that neither qualms of
conscience, nor tears, nor threats, could rid him at last of
this dread consort of the tomb. Death claimed him, and
the royal hypocrite was forced to yield to that relentless
conqueror; and Henry VIII. faced the awful tribunal
where no pretensions or shams could avail to hide the
horrid deformity of his sin-polluted soul.</p>

<p>Upon the death of Henry VIII. in 1547, his son Edward
was proclaimed king as Edward VI. But this young
king died in 1553, at the age of sixteen years, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
mighty realm of England was left to the conflicting succession
of two princesses, both of whom their royal father
had stigmatized with the ban of illegitimacy. In this
emergency the Protestants, headed by the Duke of Northumberland,
determined to set up a new claimant.</p>

<p>The daughter-in-law of the Duke of Northumberland
was Lady Jane Grey, who was the granddaughter by her
mother’s side of Mary, queen-dowager of France, and
sister of Henry VIII. Upon the death of young Edward,
the Duke of Northumberland appeared before the gentle
Lady Jane,—who was occupied in reading Plato in Greek,—and
bowing his haughty knee in the presence of his
daughter-in-law, he exclaimed:—</p>

<p>“The king, your cousin and our sovereign lord, has
surrendered his soul to God; but before his death, and in
order to preserve the kingdom from the infection of
Popery, he resolved to set aside his sisters, Mary and
Elizabeth, declared illegitimate by an act of Parliament,
and he has commanded us to proclaim your Grace as
queen and sovereign to succeed him.”</p>

<p>Thereupon the poor, unwilling Lady Jane Grey was
proclaimed queen, but dearly did she buy her ten days of
sovereign power. Mary was speedily brought to London
and declared queen, and for this innocent offence the
gentle Lady Jane Grey afterwards met death upon the
scaffold.</p>

<p>The reign of Mary was made infamously illustrious by
the execution of Lady Jane Grey and many others, and
the burning at the stake of the bishops Ridley, Latimer,
Cranmer, and many other religious martyrs. So sanguinary
was the reign of this queen that she is known in history
as <i>Bloody Mary</i>.</p>

<p>Poor Catharine of Aragon! It were surely sad enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
to have borne the many sorrows of her afflicted life, without
having her only surviving child stamped with such a
name of infamy. Mary was the first queen-regnant of
England. The queens of England are classified as queen-regnant,
queen-consort, or queen-dowager. The first
alone reigns in her own right as sole sovereign of the
realm. Of the forty queens of England beginning with
Matilda, wife of William the Conqueror, who was the first
crowned consort, and ending with Victoria, the present
queen of England, five were queens-regnant and thirty-five
queens-consort.</p>

<p>Elizabeth Tudor, the daughter of Henry VIII. and
Anne Boleyn, was born in 1533, on the seventh of September.
On the tenth of the same month, the royal babe
of three days was christened with great pomp and ceremony.</p>

<p>The walls between Greenwich Palace and the Convent
of the Grey Friars were hung with tapestry, and the
way strewn with green rushes. The baptismal font was
of silver; it was placed in the middle of the church, raised
three steps high, the steps being covered with fine cloth,
surmounted by a square canopy of crimson satin fringed
with gold, enclosed by a rail covered with red ray, and
guarded by several gentlemen with aprons and towels
about their necks. Between the choir and body of the
church a closet was erected with a pan of fire in it, that
the child might be dismantled for the ceremony without
taking cold. When all these things were ready, the child
was brought into the hall of the palace, and the procession
proceeded to the Grey Friars’ church. The citizens led
the way, two and two; then followed gentlemen, esquires,
and chaplains; after them the aldermen, then the mayor
by himself, then the privy council in robes, then the gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
of the king’s chapel in copes, then barons, earls;
then the Earl of Essex, bearing the gilt covered basin;
after him the Marquis of Exeter with a taper of virgin
wax, followed by the Earl of Dorset bearing the salt, and
the Lady Mary of Norfolk, bearing the chrism, which was
very rich with pearls and precious stones; lastly, came the
Dowager-Duchess of Norfolk, bearing in her arms the royal
infant, wrapped in a mantle of purple velvet, having a long
train furred with ermine, which was borne by the Countess
of Kent, assisted by the Earls of Wiltshire and Derby.</p>

<p>The Duchess was supported on the right side by the
Duke of Norfolk, with his marshal’s rod, and on the left
by the Duke of Suffolk—the only dukes then existing in
the peerage of England—and a rich canopy was borne
over the babe by the Lords Rochford, Hussey, and William
and Thomas Howard.</p>

<p>At the church door the child was received by the Bishop
of London, who performed the ceremony, and a grand
cavalcade of bishops and mitred abbots. The sponsors
were Archbishop Cranmer, the Dowager-Duchess of Norfolk,
and the Marchioness of Dorset.</p>

<p>The future queen was carried to the font, and with the
ceremony of the Catholic church christened Elizabeth,
after her grandmother, Elizabeth of York; and that done,
Garter King-at-Arms cried aloud, “God, of his infinite
goodness, send prosperous life and long to the high and
mighty Princess of England, Elizabeth. Then the trumpets
sounded, the princess was carried up to the altar,
the Gospel read over her, and she was confirmed by Archbishop
Cranmer and presented with the following gifts:—A
standing cup of gold by Cranmer; a similar cup fretted
with pearls, by the Duchess of Norfolk; three gilt bowls,
pounced, with covers, by the Marchioness of Dorset; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
three standard bowls graven and gilt, with covers, by the
Marchioness of Exeter. Then, after wafers and comfits
had been served in abundance, the procession returned to
the palace in the same order as it had set out, excepting
that the Earl of Worcester, Lord Thomas Howard, the
Lord Fitzwalter, and Sir John Dudley, preceded by the
trumpeters, carried the gifts of the sponsors before the
princess. Five hundred staff torches carried by the yeomen
of the guard and the king’s servants, lit up the way
homeward; and twenty gentlemen, bearing large wax
flambeaux, walked on each side of the princess, who was
carried to the queen’s chamber-door, when a flourish of
trumpets sounded and the procession dispersed.”</p>

<p>The tiny infant, christened with all this ceremony, was
created Princess of Wales when three months old; and
when in her thirteenth month, an attempt was made to
betroth her to the Duke D’Angoulême, the third son of
Francis I., of France. Rather a strange proceeding concerning
the spinster queen of England.</p>

<p>The tragic death of Anne Boleyn left this babe motherless
at three years of age.</p>

<p>The first public ceremony in which Elizabeth participated
was the christening of Edward the Sixth. She was
then just four years of age, and was borne in the arms of
the Earl of Hertford, brother to the queen, Jane Seymour.
Elizabeth carried in her tiny hands the chrism for her
new-born half-brother; and after the ceremony she walked
with infant dignity in the procession, being led by the
hand by the Princess Mary.</p>

<p>For some time, Elizabeth was allowed to reside in the
same palace with the infant Edward, and she displayed
the greatest affection for him. When she was seven
years old she made the little prince a birthday gift of “a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
shyrte of cam’yke of <i>her owne woorkynge</i>,” which was
quite precocious, considering her tender years.</p>

<p>The Princess Mary evinced great regard for her sister
Elizabeth; and when the brutal King Henry deposed both
these princesses from their rights of succession, and stigmatized
them as illegitimate, and sent word to Mary that
she should no longer treat Elizabeth as princess, Mary
wrote a letter to her father, the king, in which she kindly
mentioned Elizabeth thus: “My sister Elizabeth is in
good health, and such a child, too, as I doubt not but
your Highness shall have cause to rejoice of in time
coming.”</p>

<p>Anne of Cleves was granted permission to see Elizabeth,
even after her divorce, providing Elizabeth did not
address her as queen; and all of the wives of Henry VIII.
evinced great love for the Princess Elizabeth; and through
the influence of Catherine Parr, Henry VIII. restored
Elizabeth to her right of succession, although the act
which pronounced her illegitimate remained forever unrepealed;
and after she had become queen of England, she
refrained from requiring Parliament to repeal those acts
of her father which had declared his marriage with Anne
Boleyn null and void; and she contented herself with an
act of Parliament which declared in general terms her
rights of succession to the throne.</p>

<p>While the youthful Edward VI. was king, the Princess
Elizabeth was involved in certain questionable relations
with the Lord High Admiral Seymour, who had
married the Queen-Dowager Catherine, a few weeks after
the death of Henry VIII.</p>

<p>Upon the death of Catherine, a year afterwards, Lord
High Admiral Seymour aspired to the hand of the Princess
Elizabeth. There is no doubt that Elizabeth loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Seymour; and, as she acknowledged, would have married
him if the consent of the royal executors could have been
obtained; but as such an alliance was considered beneath
her, Elizabeth was shut up for a time in a sort of imprisonment,
and the lord high admiral was conveniently disposed
of by being led to the scaffold.</p>

<p>It is amusing to note that the hand of this much-courted
and confirmed-spinster queen was once offered by Henry
VIII. to a Scottish earl of equivocal birth and indifferent
reputation, who actually declined the honor. But Elizabeth,
when queen of England, proudly refused earls,
dukes, and even kings, though it must be confessed she
served the king of Sweden, who was one of her most constant
suitors, rather meanly; for this royal lover sent her
a magnificent present consisting of eighteen large piebald
horses, and two ships’ loads of the most precious articles
his country could produce, which princely gift Elizabeth
most graciously received, but wrote to this ardent lover,
that she anxiously hoped he would spare himself the
fatigues of a fruitless voyage,—rather strange royal etiquette,
to receive the suitor’s gift and then reject the
giver.</p>

<p>Regarding Elizabeth’s mental acquirements, her learned
preceptor, Roger Ascham, thus wrote:—</p>

<p>“The Lady Elizabeth hath accomplished her sixteenth
year; and so much solidity of understanding, such courtesy
united with dignity, have never been observed at so
early an age. She has the most ardent love of true religion
and of the best kind of literature. The constitution
of her mind is exempt from female weakness, and she is
endued with a masculine power of application. No apprehension
can be quicker than hers, no memory more retentive.
French and Italian she speaks like English; Latin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
with fluency, propriety, and judgment; she also speaks
Greek with me frequently, willingly, and moderately well.
Nothing can be more elegant than her handwriting,
whether in Greek or Roman characters. In music she is
very skilful, but does not greatly delight. With respect
to personal decoration, she greatly prefers a simple elegance
to show and splendor, so despising the outward
adorning of plaiting the hair and of wearing gold, that
in the whole manner of her life she rather resembles
Hippolita than Phœdra.</p>

<p>“She read with me almost the whole of Cicero and a
great part of Livy; from these two authors, indeed, her
knowledge of the Latin language has been almost exclusively
derived. The beginning of the day was always
devoted by her to the New Testament in Greek, after
which she read select portions of Isocrates, and the
tragedies of Sophocles, which I judged best adapted to
supply her tongue with the purest diction, her mind with
the most excellent precepts, and her exalted station with
a defence against the utmost power of fortune. For her
religious instruction she drew first from the fountains of
Scripture, and afterwards from St. Cyprian, Melancthon,
and similar works. In every kind of writing she easily
detected any ill-adapted or far-fetched expression. By
a diligent attention to these particulars, her ears became
so practised and so nice that there was nothing in Greek,
Latin, or English, prose or verse, which, according to its
merits or defects, she did not either reject with disgust
or receive with the highest delight.”</p>

<p>After the accession of Mary to the throne, the Wyatt
rebellion took place: and as it was reported that the
Princess Elizabeth was implicated, she was confined for
three months in the Tower. Elizabeth was then conveyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to Woodstock, where she endured a less rigorous imprisonment.
Her correspondence was carefully watched, and
it was with great difficulty that she succeeded at length
in appealing to the queen. It was at this time that she
wrote upon her window with a diamond the following
lines:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Much suspected, of me</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Nothing proved can be,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Quoth Elizabeth prisoner.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As her Protestant proclivities were well known, when
by the marriage of Mary to Philip of Spain, Popedom
was re-established in England, Elizabeth thought it policy
to attend the confessional; and upon one occasion being
asked what was her belief regarding the “blessed sacrament,”
she gave this famous and ambiguous answer:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Christ was the word that spake it;</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">He blessed the bread and brake it.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And what the word did make it,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">That I revere and take it.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>During this imprisonment, Elizabeth received a message
from the queen, offering her immediate liberty on condition
of her accepting the hand of the Duke of Savoy in
marriage. But the proud princess preferred imprisonment
to compulsory wedlock, and she continued for some
time longer in forced seclusion. At length Philip, the
husband of Queen Mary, who seemed to be the person
most persistent in regard to this marriage of Elizabeth,
now resolved to try more lenient measures, as severity
would not coerce her into obedience. The princess was
accordingly released from her imprisonment, and invited
to a grand ball at the palace, to which the duke was also
welcomed as a guest. Elizabeth was attired for this
occasion in a robe of white satin embroidered all over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
with pearls; but the matrimonial matters do not seem to
have advanced favorably, notwithstanding; and the death
of Queen Mary soon after left Philip of Spain a widower,
and he himself now became a suitor for the hand of the
young Queen Elizabeth. But to his suit, also, Elizabeth
turned a deaf ear, and Philip was henceforth her bitterest
enemy.</p>

<p>At the time of the accession of Elizabeth to the throne
of England, the English people were much divided in
religious opinions consequent upon the three important
theological changes which had taken place in the short
space of twelve years.</p>

<p>“King Henry VIII. retained the ecclesiastical supremacy,
with the first-fruits and tenths; maintained seven
sacraments, with obits and mass for the quick and the
dead.</p>

<p>“King Edward VI. abolished the mass, authorized one
Book of Common Prayer in English, with hallowing the
bread, and wine, etc., and established only two sacraments.</p>

<p>“Queen Mary restored all things according to the
Church of Rome, re-established the papal supremacy, and
permitted nothing within her dominions that was repugnant
to the Roman Catholic Church. But the death of
Mary was the ruin of all abbots, priors, prioresses, monks,
and nuns.</p>

<p>“Elizabeth, on her accession, commanded that no one
should preach without a special license; that such rites
and ceremonies should be used in all churches as had been
used in her Highness’ chapel; and that the Epistles and
Gospel should be read in the English tongue; and in her
first Parliament, held at Westminster, in January, 1559,
she expelled the papal supremacy, resumed the first-fruits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and tenths, repressed the mass, re-introduced the Book of
Common Prayer and the sacraments in the English tongue,
and finally firmly re-established the Protestant Church of
England.”</p>

<p>Her Majesty was twenty-five years of age at the time
of her coronation. She sent the usual notification of her
accession to the throne to the Pope at Rome. But in
answer, the fiery-spirited old man thundered forth his
maledictions at her presumption in daring to assume the
crown without his leave. Elizabeth, in reply, took upon
herself the audacious title of “the Head of the Church,”
and boldly ignored the pontifical anathemas. But she
disliked the strict Presbyterians, or Puritans, as they
were then called, almost as much as she did the Roman
Catholics. Their great leader, Knox, had published a
pamphlet upon female government, entitled “The First
Blast of the Trumpet, Against the Monstrous Regiment
of Women.” This was more than the proud queen could
stand, and Knox and the Puritans felt the power of her
displeasure. She was not over fond of preachers or of
preaching, and remarked “that two or three were enough
for a whole country.” When her clergy discoursed upon
subjects distasteful to her in their sermons, she would
frequently call out in her chapel, and command the
preacher to change the subject or restrain an exhortation
which she considered too bold. She had not the slightest
idea of tolerating any opinions contrary to her own august
will; and she told the Archbishop of Canterbury that
“she was resolved that no man should be suffered to
decline either on the left or on the right hand from the
drawn line limited by her authority and injunctions.”</p>

<p>But we have not space to give either the religious
or political aspects of Queen Elizabeth’s reign. When,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
in 1558, the death of Queen Mary was announced to her
by a deputation from the privy council who came to Hatfield
where she was then staying to salute her as queen,
she appeared much overpowered by the solemnity of the
occasion, and exclaimed, as she sank upon her knees in
devotion: “It is the Lord’s doing; it is marvellous in
our eyes!”</p>

<p>She afterwards adopted as a motto in Latin for her
gold and silver coins, “I have chosen God for my
helper.”</p>

<p>On being conducted with much pomp to the royal
apartments in the Tower, attended by an immense concourse
of people who graciously greeted her, she remarked
upon entering the well-remembered Tower where
she had once been received through the traitor’s gate as a
prisoner, but now entered the royal palace as acknowledged
sovereign: “Some have fallen from being princes
in this land to be prisoners in this place. I am raised
from being prisoner in this place to be a prince of this
land; so I must yield myself thankful to God and merciful
to man, in remembrance of the same.” She was
crowned on the 15th of January, 1558, with great splendor.
Upon the morning after her coronation, as she was
proceeding to chapel, one of her courtiers cried out with
loud voice, requesting that four or five prisoners might be
released. Upon the queen’s asking whom these prisoners
might be, he replied: “The four Evangelists and the
Apostle St. Paul, who have been long shut up in an
unknown tongue, and are not able to converse with the
people.”</p>

<p>Elizabeth answered this strange appeal by remarking:
“It is best to inquire of them whether they approve of
being released or not.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>The result of a convocation held for the discussion of
this subject was a new translation for common use.</p>

<p>In the first session of Parliament a deputation was sent
to Queen Elizabeth at Whitehall, requesting that her
Grace might think of marriage, to which Elizabeth replied:</p>

<p>“In a thing which is not very pleasing to me, the infallible
testimony of your good will and all the rest of my
people is most acceptable. As concerning your eager
persuasion of me to marriage, I must tell you I have been
ever persuaded that I was ordained by God to consider,
and above all, to do those things which appertain to his
glory. And therefore it is that I have made choice of
this kind of life. To conclude, I am already bound unto
a husband, which is the kingdom of England, and let that
suffice you;” saying which she extended her finger upon
which she wore the ring with which the ceremony of her
coronation had been performed. This same demand of
the Parliament was subsequently repeated many times, but
until the end of her life Elizabeth took pleasure in keeping
England and the world in suspense by her grave
coquetries, which from time to time betokened a probable
marriage which she herself never apparently desired.
Proposals for her hand poured in from every court of
Europe, but though she entertained some of them for a
time, she always managed to break them off in the end.
The man whom she probably really desired to marry after
she became queen was her favorite Dudley, whom she
afterwards created Earl of Leicester. So great was her
evident fancy for this man that she might have consented
had he been free; and when the sudden and suspicious
death of his wife left his hand at her disposal, the horror
of the people who believed him guilty of wife-murder
restrained her from thus lowering her queenly dignity. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
spite of deceit and all kinds of wily intrigues, this subtle
sycophant succeeded in retaining his place as favorite
until his death, notwithstanding his base plots and false
pretensions.</p>

<p>The century immediately preceding the reign of Elizabeth
was renowned for three most illustrious events,—the
invention of printing, which took place about 1448; the
discovery of America in 1492; and the reformation in
1517.</p>

<p>The age of Elizabeth was also fertile in great events
and in great men. “It was the age of heroism and genius,
of wonderful mental activity, extraordinary changes
and daring enterprises, of fierce struggles for religious
or political freedom. It produced a Shakespeare, the
first of poets; Bacon, the great philosopher; Hooker, the
great divine; Drake, the great seaman, and the first of
English circumnavigators; Gresham, the great merchant;
and Sydney, noblest of courtiers; and Spenser, and
Raleigh, and Essex, names renowned in history and song.
In other countries we find Luther, the reformer; and
Sully, the statesman; Ariosto and Tasso; Cervantes and
Camöens; Michel Angelo, Titian, and Correggio; Palestrina,
the father of Italian music; all these, and many
other famous men never since surpassed were nearly
contemporary; it was an age of greatness, and Elizabeth
was great and illustrious in connection with it.”</p>

<p>The reign of “Good Queen Bess” has been held in
reverence, in comparison with that of “Bloody Mary,”
her sister, which was stamped with infamy; and the
“Elizabethan age” is one of the most illustrious in the
annals of literature.</p>

<p>The government of Elizabeth was acknowledged to
have been admirably managed, as regards her foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
policy, her wars, treaties, and alliances with other European
powers. With the exception of Leicester and Hatton,
her statesmen were well chosen. Lord Burleigh was her
prime minister for forty years, and Sir Nicholas Bacon,
and his more famous son, Francis, were among her wise
and remarkable ministers.</p>

<p>Navigation, manufactures, and trade, made great advance
during her reign. She was the first to establish
trade with Turkey and Russia, and was the first sovereign
who sent ambassadors to those courts. Mirrors
and drinking-glasses from Venice, also porcelain and
damask linen were then first introduced into England; but
with all this advance forks were still unknown, and Queen
Elizabeth, and her elegant belaced courtiers, and her
stately beruffed dames, still ate with their fingers.</p>

<p>The first pair of knitted silk stockings ever made in
England was presented to Queen Elizabeth in 1560 by
her silk-woman. So much did she enjoy this luxury of
dress, that she henceforth discarded her hose of cloth,
and never after wore any other than those of silk.</p>

<p>Although her preceptor had described the youthful
Princess Elizabeth as plain and sombre in her mode of
dress, Queen Elizabeth was famous for her extravagant
and showy costumes, and her great vanity regarding her
appearance. So outrageous in size did her favorite ruffs
become, when the fashion was adopted by her court
ladies, that a royal proclamation was issued limiting them
to a certain number of inches in height, Elizabeth retaining
the privilege of wearing them larger and higher than
any of her ladies; and bishops thundered forth their condemnations
regarding the growing extravagance of dress,
cautioning their hearers against “fine-fingered rufflers,
with sable about their necks, corked slippers, trimmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
buskins, and warm mittens. These tender Parnels” said
they, “must have one gown for the day, another for the
night; one long, another short; one for winter, another
for summer; one furred through, another but faced; one
for the work-day, another for the holy-day; one of this
color, another of that; one of cloth, another of silk or
damask. Change of apparel, one afore dinner, another
after; one of Spanish fashion, another of Turkey; and to
be brief, never content with enough, but always devising
new and strange fashions. Yea, a ruffian will have more
in his ruff and his hose than he should spend in a year;
he who ought to go in a russet coat spends as much on
apparel for himself and his wife as his father would have
kept a good house with.”</p>

<p>“The costumes of that age were magnificent. Gowns
of velvet or satin, richly trimmed with silk, furs, or gold
lace, costly gold chains, and caps or hoods of rich materials,
adorned with feathers, decorated on all occasions of
ceremony the persons not only of nobles and courtiers,
but of their retainers, and even of the substantial citizens.
The attire of the ladies was proportionally splendid.
Hangings of cloth, of silk, and of velvet, cloth of gold,
and cloth of silver, or ‘<i>needle-work sublime</i>’ adorned on
days of family festivities the principal chamber of every
house of respectable appearance; and on public festivals
these rich draperies were suspended from the balconies,
and, combined with the banners and pennons floating overhead,
gave to the streets an appearance resembling a
suite of long and gayly dressed <i>salons</i>.”</p>

<p>Queen Elizabeth was very fond of display and gorgeous
pageants, and her royal <i>progresses</i> were always
attended with magnificent spectacles of various kinds:
sometimes a splendid water procession on the Thames;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
again, she rode on horseback, attended by lords and ladies
attired in crimson velvet, with their horses caparisoned
with the same rich material.</p>

<p>The band of gentlemen pensioners, which was the boast
and ornament of Elizabeth’s court, was composed of the
flower of the English nobility, and to be admitted to serve
in its ranks was regarded as a high distinction.</p>

<p>Music was much in fashion in Elizabeth’s court, and
she excelled Mary, Queen of Scots, on keyed instruments,
though Mary played best upon the lute. An instrument
resembling a small guitar was much used as an accompaniment
to the voice.</p>

<p>Elizabeth gave little patronage to painting or architecture;
the former art she encouraged only so far as regarded
the multiplication of pictures of herself. At length so
many were the poor portraits of her which appeared, and
were mostly caricatures of her royal face and person, that
the queen issued a proclamation prohibiting all persons
from drawing, painting, or engraving her countenance or
figure, until some perfect pattern should be made by a
skilful limner. But her painters did not flatter her as
much as her poets.</p>

<p>“The portraits remaining of Elizabeth show how vile,
how tawdry, and how vulgar was her taste in art. They
could hardly be fine enough to please her; they seem all
made up of jewels, crowns, and frizzled hair, powdered
with diamonds, and ruffs and cuffs and farthingales and
things; and from the midst of this superfluity of ornament,
her pinched Roman nose, thin lips, and sharp eyes
peer out with a very disagreeable effect, quite contrary to
all our ideas of grace or majesty.” She was so little capable
of judging a work of art that she would not allow a
painter to put any shadows upon the face, because, she
said, “shade is an accident, and not in nature.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Many stories are told illustrating Elizabeth’s extreme
vanity. Sir John Harrington relates:—</p>

<p>“That Lady M. Howard was possessed of a rich border
powdered with golde and pearle, and a velvet suite belonging
thereto, which moved many to envye; nor did it please
the queene, who thought it exceeded her own. One daye
the queene did sende privately, and got the lady’s rich vesture,
which she put on herself, and came forthe the chamber
among the ladies. The kirtle and border was far too
shorte for her majestie’s height, and she asked every one
how they liked her new-fancied suit. At length she asked
the owner herself ‘if it was not made too short and ill-becoming,’
which the poor ladie did presentlie consent to.
‘Why, then, if it become not me as being too shorte, I
am minded it shall never become thee as being too fine;
so it fitteth neither well.’ This sharp rebuke abashed the
ladie, and she never adorned herself herewith any more.”</p>

<p>The sight of her own face in a mirror, as she grew
old and became still more unprepossessing in appearance,
threw her into “transports of rage,” and towards the end
of her life she discontinued the use of a mirror, and it is
said that her tire-women “sometimes indulged their own
hatred and mirth, and ventured to lay upon the royal nose
the carmine which ought to have embellished the cheeks,”
confident that her aversion to a mirror would screen their
pranks. Still the herd of flatterers around her were forced
to address her as a goddess of beauty, and she actually
seemed to think she could play the part of a Venus at the
age of sixty-five. Or she was at least pleased when her
fawning courtiers called her one.</p>

<p>Sir James Melville gives this amusing account of Elizabeth’s
jealousy of the beauty and attractions of her hated
rival, Mary, Queen of Scots. Melville had been sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
from Scotland to London by Mary, to interview Elizabeth
concerning certain matters. Sir James writes: “At
divers meetings we had conversations on different subjects.
The queen, my mistress, had instructed me to leave
matters of gravity sometimes, and cast in merry purposes,
lest otherwise she should be wearied, she being well informed
of her natural temper. Therefore, in declaring
my observations of the customs of Holland, Poland, and
Italy, the buskins of the women were not forgot, and
what country weed I thought best becoming gentlewomen.
The queen said she had clothes of every sort, which every
day thereafter, so long as I was there, she changed.</p>

<p>“One day she had the English weed, another day the
French, another the Italian, and so on. She asked me
which of them became her best? I answered, in my judgment
the Italian dress; which answer I found pleased her
well, for she delighted to show her golden-colored hair,
wearing a caul and a bonnet, as they do in Italy. Her
hair was rather reddish than yellow, curled in appearance
naturally. She desired to know what color of hair was
reputed best; and whether my queen’s hair or hers was
best; and which of them was fairest? I said she was the
fairest queen in England, and mine in Scotland; yet still
she appeared earnest. I then told her they were both the
fairest ladies in their respective countries; that her Majesty
was whiter, but my queen was very lovely. She
inquired which of them was highest in stature. I said
my queen. Then said she, ‘She is too high, for I myself
am neither too high nor too low.’ She inquired if she
played well upon the lute and the virginals? I said reasonably
for a queen.</p>

<p>“That same day, after dinner, my Lord of Hunsdon
drew me to a quiet gallery, that I might hear some music,—but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
he said he durst not avow it,—where I might hear
the queen play upon the virginals. After I had harkened
awhile, I stood by the tapestry that hung before the door
of the chamber, and seeing her back was towards the
door, I ventured within the chamber and stood at a pretty
space, hearing her play excellently well; but she left off
immediately as soon as she turned about and saw me.
She appeared surprised and came forward, seeming to
strike me with her hand, alleging that she used not to play
before men, but when she was solitary, to shun melancholy.
She asked how I came there. I answered, as I
was walking with my Lord of Hunsdon we passed by the
chamber door; I heard such melody as ravished me,
whereby I was drawn in ere I knew how; excusing my
fault of homeliness, as being brought up in the court of
France, where such freedom was allowed; declaring myself
willing to endure whatever punishment her Majesty
should please to inflict upon me for so great an offence.
Then she sat down low upon a cushion, and I upon my
knees by her, but with her own hand she gave me a cushion
to place under my knee, which at first I refused, but
she compelled me to take it. She then called for my Lady
Strafford out of the next chamber, for the queen was
alone. She inquired whether my queen or she played
best. In that I found myself obliged to give her the
praise. She said my French was very good, and asked
if I could speak Italian, which she spoke reasonably well.
I told her Majesty I had no time to learn that language,
not having been above two months in Italy. Then she
spoke to me in Dutch, which was not good, and would
know what kind of books I most delighted in, whether
theology, history, or <i>love matters</i>. I said I liked well of
<i>all</i> the sorts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“I now took occasion to press earnestly my despatch;
she said I was sooner weary of her company than she was
of mine. I told her Majesty that though I had no reason
to be weary, I knew my mistress’s affairs called me home.
Yet I was detained two days longer, that I might see her
dance, as I was afterwards informed; which being over,
she inquired of me whether she or my queen danced best?
I answered, the queen danced not so <i>high</i>, nor so disposedly
as she did. Then again she wished that she might
see the queen at some convenient place of meeting. I
offered to convey her secretly to Scotland by post horses,
clothed like a page, that under this disguise she might see
the queen. She appeared to like that kind of language,
but only answered it with a sigh, saying, ‘Alas! if I
might do it thus!’ I then withdrew.”</p>

<p>The rise of English manufacture is dated from the reign
of Queen Elizabeth. The first paper-mill was set up in
1590, and watches and coaches were first introduced into
England during her reign. “When we hear of Elizabeth
riding to the House of Peers on a pillion in the beginning
of her reign, we should not forget that towards the close
of it she is represented as taking an airing in her coach
every day.”</p>

<p>“The daily ceremonial of her court was distinguished
by ‘Oriental servility.’ Her table was served kneeling,
and with as many genuflections as would have contented
the Emperor of China. Even her ministers never addressed
her but on their knees. From this slavish ceremony
Lord Burleigh was latterly excused, when age and
infirmities had rendered it painful or rather impracticable;
but he was the only exception.”</p>

<p>It has been said “that Elizabeth never forgot the
woman in the sovereign; and that with greater truth she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
never forget the sovereign in the woman.” Poor praise,
truly! without heart, without capacity for any kindliness
or womanly tenderness, she lived without a friend and
died without a mourner. Courtiers grovelled in fawning
servility at her feet, women feared her; but no one loved
her, and even those who flattered her despised her.</p>

<p>Of her two celebrated favorites, Leicester and Essex,
the first was perfidious and utterly worthless; the latter
was too manly to bear her insolence, and for that he lost
his head. He was too spirited to cringe at her footstool,
and when on one occasion she angrily boxed his ear, he
exclaimed, in indignation, “I would not have taken such
an affront from the hands of the king, her father, and I
will not accept it of a petticoat! I owe her Majesty the
duty of an earl, but I will never serve her as a slave!”</p>

<p>But nevertheless, the petticoat would not be opposed,
and Essex perished on the fatal block, even though his
death wrung the small heart Elizabeth possessed with all
the sorrow it was capable of feeling. She had given
Essex a ring in the time of his influence, telling him, if
ever he was in danger to send it to her and she would
aid him. When he was sentenced to die, he sent Queen
Elizabeth this ring, but it passed through the hands of a
court lady whose husband was Essex’s deadly foe. The
ring never reached the queen, and Essex was executed.
Years after, when this countess was dying she confessed
the fate of the ring to the queen. The sorrow and remorse
which Elizabeth experienced on knowing that her favorite
had thus appealed to her mercy, hastened her own death.</p>

<p>It was during the reign of Queen Elizabeth that Sir
Francis Drake accomplished the journey around the world
and Sir Walter Raleigh made his famous voyages. Tobacco
was first introduced into England by him. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
amusing story is told of the first use of the weed. He was
smoking a pipe one day, when his servant came into the
room bearing a tankard of ale. The simple fellow had
never before witnessed the process of smoking, and supposing
that the clouds of smoke issuing from his master’s
lips betokened some awful accident, he flung the ale into
his face and ran from the room, crying that his master
was on fire and would be burned to ashes if they did not
come to his aid.</p>

<p>Raleigh once amused the queen by making a wager with
her that he could tell her the exact weight of the smoke of
every pipeful of tobacco that he consumed. The wager
was accepted by the queen, and Raleigh thereupon proceeded
to weigh the tobacco he placed in his pipe, and,
after smoking, he weighed the ashes remaining, and informed
her that the difference between the two was the
exact weight of the smoke. Elizabeth paid the wager,
saying: “That she knew of many persons who had
turned their gold into smoke, but that he was the first
one who had turned smoke into gold.” The well-known
gallantry of this same Raleigh in spreading his new velvet
cloak over the muddy walk for his royal mistress to
tread upon, not only secured him many new cloaks, but
the powerful patronage of the queen.</p>

<p>It was to Queen Elizabeth that the poet Spenser dedicated
his poetical muse, and in his “Faerie Queene” he
celebrated and exalted his sovereign. But the greatest
name of her reign, and the one which has shed the brightest
and most lasting lustre upon the Elizabethan age, was
the illustrious Shakespeare. It is stated that the “Merry
Wives of Windsor” was composed by order of Queen
Elizabeth, who, having been pleased with Falstaff, in the
play of “Henry IV.,” desired to see more of him. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
supposed that between 1590 and 1603 Shakespeare produced
the plays of “Venus and Adonis,” “Two Gentlemen
of Verona,” “Love’s Labor Lost,” “Taming of the
Shrew,” “Henry IV., V., VI. and VIII.,” “Midsummer-Night’s
Dream,” “Hamlet,” “Richard II. and III.,”
“Romeo and Juliet,” “King John,” “As You Like It,”
“Merchant of Venice,” “All’s Well that Ends Well,”
“Much Ado About Nothing,” and “Merry Wives of
Windsor”; and before 1606: “Troilus and Cressida,”
“Othello,” “Twelfth Night,” “Measure for Measure,”
“Comedy of Errors,” “King Lear,” and “Macbeth.”
So that nearly all of these works appeared in the reign of
Elizabeth, who died in 1603.</p>

<p>Elizabeth’s contest against Philip II. of Spain, in assisting
the Dutch in their war against Spanish tyranny, was
one of the most illustrious of her foreign enterprises. In
this war of liberty against despotism, Elizabeth’s bravest
commanders and most accomplished courtiers distinguished
themselves.</p>

<p>The two conflicting opinions regarding the character and
reign of Elizabeth are thus ably stated by an illustrious
writer: “Almost from our infancy we have a general
impression that her reign is distinguished as one of the
most memorable in history; and at a later period we hear
of the ‘Elizabethan age’ as equally illustrious in the
annals of our literature. Her wisdom, her courage, her
prudence and her patriotism, her unconquerable spirit, her
excellent laws and vigilant government, her successes at
home and abroad, her wars and alliances with the greatest
and most powerful princes of her time, the magnificent
position which England maintained in her reign as the
stronghold of the reformed religion, her own grandeur
as the guardian of the Protestants and the arbitress of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Europe, her magnanimous stand in defence of the national
faith and independence when the Spanish Armada
was defeated in 1588; the long list of great men, warriors,
statesmen, and poets, who sustained her throne, who
graced her court, obeyed her slightest word, lived in her
smiles and worshipped as she passed,—all these things
are familiar to young people almost from the time they
can remember, and they leave a strong and magnificent
impression on the fancy. As we grow older and become
acquainted with the particular details of history, we begin
to perceive with surprise that this splendid array of great
names and great achievements has another and a far different
aspect. On looking nearer we behold on the throne
of England a woman whose avarice and jealousy, whose
envious, relentless, and malignant spirit, whose coarse
manners and violent temper render her contemptible.
We see England, the country of freedom, ruled as absolutely
as any Turkish province by this imperious sultana
and her grand vizier, Burleigh; we see human blood
poured out like water on the scaffold, and persecution,
torture, and even death again inflicted for the sake of
religion; we see great men, whose names are the glory
of their country, pining in neglect, and a base, unworthy
favorite revelling in power. We read and learn these
things with astonishment; we find it difficult to reconcile
such apparent contradictions.”</p>

<p>Such are the difficulties which meet us in the study of
the reign of Queen Elizabeth; but a close study of the
contradictions in the character of Elizabeth herself will
partly solve the seeming mystery. Elizabeth possessed
great and heroic traits of character, but these were joined
to such a pitiably weak, jealous, and treacherous nature as
to make her an anomaly in the history of the world. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
lived in an illustrious age, fraught with some of the most
momentous events in the annals of time; in a century
star-studded with the lustrous names of genius, whose
immortal fame has shed a reflex glory on her reign.
Interests vital to the progress of humanity teemed and
surged around her throne, and lifted her glory high on the
topmost crests of the glistening waves of the on-rushing
ocean of enlightened civilization and religious liberty.</p>

<p>Hentzner, the German traveller, who visited England
in 1599, thus describes Elizabeth’s court four years previous
to her death:—</p>

<p>“The presence-chamber was hung with rich tapestry,
and the floor, after the English fashion, strewn with hay,
through which the queen commonly passed on her way to
chapel. At the door stood a gentleman dressed in velvet,
with a gold chain, whose office was to introduce to the
queen any person of distinction who came to wait upon
her. It was Sunday, when there was usually the greatest
attendance of nobility. In the same hall were the Archbishop
of Canterbury, the Bishop of London, a great
number of councillors of state, officers of the crown, and
gentlemen who waited the queen’s coming out, which she
did from her own apartment when it was time to go to
prayers, attended in the following manner: first went
gentlemen, barons, earls, Knights of the Garter, all richly
dressed and bareheaded; next came the chancellor, bearing
the seals in a red silk purse, between two, one of
which carried the royal sceptre, the other the sword of
state in a red scabbard studded with golden <i>fleur-de-lys</i>,
the point upward.</p>

<p>“Next came the queen, in the sixty-sixth year of her
age, as we were told, very majestic; her face oblong, fair,
but wrinkled; her eyes small, yet black and pleasant; her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
nose a little hooked, her lips narrow and her teeth black
(a defect the English seem subject to, from their too
great use of sugar). She had in her ears two pearls, with
very rich drops; she wore false hair, and that red; upon
her head she had a small crown, reported to be made of
some of the gold of the celebrated Lunebourg table. Her
bosom was uncovered, as all the English ladies have it till
they marry, and she had on a necklace of exceeding fine
jewels. Her hands were small, her fingers long, and her
stature neither tall nor low; her air was stately, her manner
of speaking mild and obliging. That day she was
dressed in white silk, bordered with pearls of the size of
beans, and over it a mantle of black silk, shot with silver
threads; her train was very long, the end of it borne by a
marchioness. Instead of a chain she had a collar of gold
and jewels. As she went along in all this state and magnificence,
she spoke very graciously, first to one, then to
another, in English, French, and Italian; for besides
being well skilled in Greek, Latin, and the languages I
have mentioned, she is mistress of Spanish, Scotch, and
Dutch. Whoever speaks to her it is kneeling; now and
then she raises some with her hand. Wherever she turned
her face as she was going along everybody fell down on
their knees. The ladies of the court followed next to
her, very handsome and well shaped, and for the most
part dressed in white. She was guarded on each side by
the gentlemen pensioners, fifty in number, with gilt battle-axes.
In the ante-chapel, next the hall, where we were,
petitions were presented to her, and she received them
most graciously, which occasioned the acclamation of
‘Long live Queen Elizabeth!’”</p>

<p>But while the queen was still at service in the chapel,
her table was set out with the following solemnity:—<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>“A gentleman entered the room, bearing a rod, and
along with him another, who had a table-cloth, which,
after they had both kneeled three times with the utmost
veneration, he spread upon the table, and after kneeling
again they both retired. Then came two others, one with
the rod again, the other with a salt-cellar, a plate, and
bread; when they had kneeled as the others had done,
and placed what was brought upon the table, they too
retired, with the same ceremonies performed by the first.
At last came an unmarried lady (we were told she was a
countess), and along with her a married one, bearing a
tasting knife; the former was dressed in white silk, who,
when she had prostrated herself three times in the most
graceful manner, approached the table and rubbed the
plates with bread and salt, with as much awe as if the
queen had been present. When they had waited there a
little while, the yeomen of the guard entered, bareheaded,
clothed in scarlet, with a golden rose upon their backs,
bringing in at each turn a course of twenty-four dishes,
served in plate, most of it gilt; these dishes were received
by a gentleman in the same order they were brought, and
placed upon the table, while the lady-taster gave to each
of the guard a mouthful to eat of the particular dish he
had brought, for fear of any poison. During the time
that this guard,—which consists of the tallest and
stoutest men that can be found in all England, being
carefully selected for this service,—were bringing dinner,
twelve trumpets and two kettle-drums made the hall ring
for half an hour together.</p>

<p>“At the end of all this ceremonial a number of unmarried
ladies appeared, who, with particular solemnity, lifted
the meat off the table, and conveyed it into the queen’s
inner and more private chamber, where, after she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
chosen for herself, the rest goes to the ladies of the court.
The queen dines and sups alone, with very few attendants;
and it is very seldom that anybody, foreign or
native, is admitted at that time, and then only at the
intercession of some person in power.”</p>

<p>This same traveller, Hentzner, states “that he
counted on London bridge no less than three hundred
heads of persons who had been executed for high treason.”
Surely a lamentable evidence of Elizabeth’s cruelty.</p>

<p>J. R. Green, M. A., in his “History of the English
People,” thus sketches the character of Queen Elizabeth:—</p>

<p>“Her moral temper recalled in its strange contrasts the
mixed blood within her veins. She was at once the
daughter of Henry and Anne Boleyn. From her father
she inherited her frank and hearty address, her love of
popularity and of free intercourse with the people, her
dauntless courage, her amazing self-confidence. Her
harsh, man-like voice, her impetuous will, her pride, her
furious outbursts of anger, came to her with her Tudor
blood. She rated great nobles as if they were school-boys;
she met the insolence of Essex with a box on the
ear; she would break, now and then, into the gravest
deliberations, to swear at her ministers like a fish-wife.</p>

<p>“But strangely in contrast with the violent outlines of
her Tudor temper stood the sensuous, self-indulgent
nature she derived from Anne Boleyn. Splendor and
pleasure were with Elizabeth the very air she breathed.
Her delight was to move in perpetual progresses from
castle to castle through a series of gorgeous pageants,
fanciful and extravagant as a caliph’s dream. She loved
gayety and laughter and wit. A happy retort or a
finished compliment never failed to win her favor. She
hoarded jewels. Her dresses were innumerable. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
vanity remained even to old age, the vanity of a coquette
in her teens. No adulation was too fulsome for her, no
flattery of her beauty too gross. She would play with
her rings, that her courtiers might note the delicacy of her
hands; or dance a coranto, that the French ambassador,
hidden dexterously behind a curtain, might report her
sprightliness to his master. Her levity, her frivolous
laughter, her unwomanly jests, gave color to a thousand
scandals. Her character, in fact, like her portraits, was
utterly without shade. Of womanly reserve or self-restraint
she knew nothing. No instinct of delicacy veiled
the voluptuous temper which had broken out in the romps
of her girlhood, and showed itself almost ostentatiously
throughout her later life. Personal beauty in a man was
a sure passport to her liking. She patted handsome
young squires on the neck when they knelt to kiss her
hand, and fondled her ‘sweet Robin,’—Lord Leicester,—in
the face of the court.</p>

<p>“It was no wonder that the statesmen whom she outwitted
held Elizabeth almost to the last to be little more
than a frivolous woman. But the Elizabeth whom they
saw was far from being all of Elizabeth. The wilfulness
of Henry, the triviality of Anne Boleyn, played over the
surface of a nature hard as steel, a temper purely intellectual,
the very type of reason untouched by imagination
or passion. Luxurious and pleasure-loving as she seemed,
Elizabeth lived simply and frugally, and she worked hard.
Her vanity and caprice had no weight whatever with her
state affairs. The coquette of the presence-chamber
became the coolest and hardest of politicians at the
council-board. Fresh from the flattery of her courtiers,
she would tolerate no flattery in the closet; she was herself
plain and downright of speech with her councillors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
and she looked for a corresponding plainness of speech in
return. Her expenditure was parsimonious, and even
miserly. If any trace of her sex lingered in her actual
statesmanship, it was seen in the simplicity and tenacity
of purpose that often underlie a woman’s fluctuations of
feeling. It was this in part which gave her her marked
superiority over the statesmen of her time. No nobler
group of ministers ever gathered round a council-board
than those who gathered round the council-board of
Elizabeth. But she is the instrument of none. She
listens, she weighs, she uses or puts by the counsels of
each in turn, but her policy as a whole is her own. It
was a policy, not of genius, but of good sense.
Of political wisdom, indeed, in its larger and more generous
sense, Elizabeth had little or none; but her political
tact was unerring. It was a policy of detail, and in
details her wonderful readiness and ingenuity found scope
for their exercise. She played with grave cabinets as a
cat plays with a mouse, and with much of the same feline
delight in the mere embarrassment of her victims.</p>

<p>“Had Elizabeth written the story of her reign, she
would have prided herself, not on the triumph of England
or the ruin of Spain, but on the skill with which she had
hoodwinked and outwitted every statesman in Europe during
fifty years. Nor was her trickery without political
value. Nothing is more revolting in the queen, but nothing
is more characteristic, than her shameless mendacity.
It was an age of political lying, but in the profusion and
recklessness of her lies Elizabeth stood without a peer in
Christendom. A falsehood was to her simply an intellectual
means of meeting a difficulty.</p>

<p>“She had a quick eye for merit of any sort, and a wonderful
power of enlisting its whole energy in her service.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Her success, indeed, in securing from the beginning of
her reign to its end, with the single exception of Leicester,
precisely the right men for the work she set them to do,
sprang in great measure from the noblest characteristic
of her intellect.</p>

<p>“Elizabeth could talk poetry with Spenser and philosophy
with Bruno; she could discuss euphuism with Lyly,
and enjoy the chivalry of Essex; she could turn from talk
of the latest fashions, to pore with Cecil over despatches
and treasury books; she could pass from tracking traitors
with Walsingham, to settle points of doctrine with Parker,
or to calculate with Frobisher the chances of a northwest
passage to the Indies. The versatility and many-sidedness
of her mind enabled her to understand every phase
of the intellectual movement of her day, and to fix by a
sort of instinct on its higher representatives. But the
greatness of the queen rests above all on her power over
her people. We have had grander and nobler rulers, but
none so popular as Elizabeth. It was only on her intellectual
side that Elizabeth touched the England of her
day. All its moral aspects were simply dead to her.
She made her market with equal indifference out of the
heroism of William of Orange or the bigotry of Philip.
The noblest aims and lives were only counters on her
board. No woman ever lived who was so destitute of
the sentiment of religion. While the world around her
was being swayed more and more by theological beliefs
and controversies, Elizabeth was absolutely untouched by
them.”</p>

<p>For nineteen long years Queen Elizabeth kept the beautiful
Mary, Queen of Scots, in captivity, without right or
reason, Mary Stuart’s defenders declare; but Elizabeth’s
upholders claim that Mary was guilty of many plots
against the English Queen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>It is almost impossible to tread the mazy paths of this
epoch with impartial glance and unbiassed opinions. The
writers on both sides of these knotty questions are able
and apparently conscientious. We can but state both
sides, and leave the reader to form his or her own opinion.</p>

<p>That Mary, Queen of Scots, could have been subjected
to all the terrible trials and awful accusations which fell
upon her seemingly defenceless head and still be entirely
innocent of the crimes alleged against her, is quite possible,
considering her peculiar situation and the selfish
hatred of her enemies; yet those who believe in her guilt
bring forth very strong evidence to prove that she connived
at murder, and willingly gave herself into the power
of the murderer.</p>

<p>This seems too atrocious to claim regarding a woman
of the otherwise winning and kindly character of Mary,
Queen of Scots. When two entire nations,—and one of
them governed by a keen-witted, dissembling, and weakly-jealous
queen,—are joined to destroy one poor helpless
woman, and that woman a prisoner in the hands of her
enemies, with spies at every keyhole and adversaries on
every side, hoping to raise themselves to power by her
destruction,—it is hardly to be wondered at that evidence
can be found or forged which shall aid them in overwhelming
her in ruin and at length in death.</p>

<p>Either Mary, Queen of Scots, stands forth in history
as the most diabolical instance of hypocritical innocence
cloaking the blackest of infamy which the world affords,—for
she was too enlightened to be excused as a Cleopatra,
and too apparently an embodiment of womanly
loveliness and gentleness to be shunned as a Catherine de’
Medici, and therefore all the more dangerous and insidious
a tempter to lead others to hideous crimes;—or she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
was the most pathetic and helpless victim of the most
nefarious intrigues, which seemingly none but the devils
in Hades could have originated and carried out, to
the lasting disgrace of civilized and so-called Christian
nations, and the indelible dishonor of the heartless sovereign
who abetted and consummated such an atrocious
crime.</p>

<p>Either Mary, Queen of Scots, or Elizabeth, Queen of
England, must be stamped with disgrace and even infamy;
or <i>both</i> of them were victims in the hands of fiendish
aspirants for power,—the <i>one</i>, <i>unwillingly</i>, helpless
as a prisoner, treacherously betrayed; the <i>other</i>, <i>willingly</i>,
tarnishing her royal glory out of weak jealousy veiled
under hypocritical protestations of political policy and
unselfish devotion to the welfare of her subjects.</p>

<p>If Elizabeth was guilty of putting to death an innocent
and persecuted kinswoman, who, relying on her avowed
declarations of love and friendship, fled to her for safety,
only to meet a lingering and dishonorable imprisonment,
and an outrageous and ignominious death, at the hands
of her who basely professed the tenderest sympathy and
sisterly affection,—then Mary, Queen of Scots’ tragic
death is unparalleled in history; for though other queens
have died upon the scaffold, the executioner’s hand was
not lifted at the command of a <i>near</i> and <i>professedly-devoted</i>
relation; nor did an <i>only son</i> behold his mother’s
shameful death without raising hand or word to help her
when that <i>son</i> was a <i>king</i> upon a throne. That Mary
Queen of Scots, rightfully claimed the throne of Scotland
is beyond dispute; that she also rightfully claimed her
place as successor to Elizabeth for the throne of England,
is clearly proven from the fact that her son, James VI.
of Scotland, ascended the throne of England, as James<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
I., upon the death of Elizabeth, without any seeming
opposition or question of his rights of succession.</p>

<p>Mary Stuart, queen of Scotland, was born on the 7th
of December, 1542, in the palace of Linlithgow. The
blood of the two rival claimants of the crown of Scotland,
John Baliol and Robert Bruce, mingled in the veins of
Mary Stuart.</p>

<p>“It was the injustice of Henry VIII.’s will in ignoring
the descendants of his eldest sister, and placing those of
the youngest in the order of the regal succession next his
own children, which rendered it expedient for Mary,
Queen of Scots, afterwards to obtain a recognition of her
rights from Elizabeth, although in point of legitimacy,
Mary’s lineal title to the throne of England was considered
by all the Roman Catholics in Europe, and the
people still attached to that communion in England and
Ireland, as more valid than that of Elizabeth. Elizabeth
had, however, been recognized by the Parliament of England
as the successor of her late sister, Queen Mary I.,
and solemnly accepted by the realm on the day of her
consecration as the sovereign. It was therefore futile to
urge in depreciation of her title the stigma which her
unnatural father’s declaration, her unfortunate mother’s
admission, and Cranmer’s sentence, had combined to pass
upon her legitimacy, for, according to the constitutional
laws of England, the crown had taken away all defects
that might previously have existed. The demand of Mary
Stuart to be acknowledged as her successor was in itself
the strongest recognition of the unimpugnable nature of
Elizabeth’s rights, and therefore ought to have been met
in a friendly spirit, instead of being repelled in a manner
which naturally inspired suspicions in the mind of Mary,
that Elizabeth intended to supersede her legitimate claims<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
in favor either of one of the descendants of the youngest
sister of Margaret Tudor, or to bring forward the Earl
of Huntingdon, great-grandson of George, Duke of
Clarence.”</p>

<p>It was poor Mary Stuart’s first father-in-law, Henry II.
of France, who cost her her head, by prematurely declaring
her queen of England, in 1559, and it was largely
owing to the base treacheries and plots of her second
father-in-law, the Earl of Lennox, that the net-work of
vile lies, and slanders were spread about her in Scotland,
which afterwards so fatally entrapped her, to which the
weak and vacillating Darnley lent himself by turns, and
then repenting, sued for pardon, which the forgiving Mary
had no sooner granted, than he was again persuaded by
her enemies to betray her.</p>

<p>In the midst of the labyrinth of conflicting testimonies
and evidences, a thread has been found which, following
it to its source, leads us to the English court of Elizabeth,
as the first instigator of those infamous lies which so
many historians have claimed to be the truth, and which,
if so, must perforce stigmatize the unfortunate Mary,
Queen of Scots, as guilty beyond doubt of the terrible
crimes of which she was accused. But researches have
revealed a deeper-laid scheme than was for a long time
imagined, and which, if true, brands the English cabinet,
and to some extent Elizabeth herself, as an accessory to
that scheme,—though we will give her the credit to suppose
that her aid was gained by keeping her in ignorance
of the vileness of the plot,—with as great, and even
greater infamy, than has ever rested upon the probably
guiltless name of the persecuted Queen of Scots. In
proof whereof, we will give the statements which bear
upon this point in their proper place in the sketch of
Mary Stuart’s life, as we proceed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>“With the exceptions of Queen Elizabeth, Catherine
de’ Medici, and the Countess of Shrewsbury, Mary had no
female enemies. No female witnesses from her household
came forward to bear testimony against her when it was
out of her power to purchase secrecy, if they had been
cognizant of her guilt. None of the ladies of her court,
whether of the reformed religion or of the old faith—not
even Lady Bothwell herself—lifted up her voice to
impute blame to her. Mary was attended by noble
Scotch gentlewomen in the days of her royal splendor;
they clave to her in adversity, through good report and
evil report; they shared her prisons, they waited upon her
on the scaffold, and forsook not her mangled remains till
they had seen them consigned to a long-denied tomb.”</p>

<p>Truly such faithful friendships throughout a life of sorrow
and continued aspersions against her character speak
volumes on the side of Mary’s innocence.</p>

<p>Mary Stuart was but a few days old, when James V.,
her royal father, died. When Mary was nine months of
age the royal ceremonial of her coronation was solemnized.
The baby queen was crowned with all the solemnities
usual upon the inauguration of the kings of Scotland.
The tiny infant was wrapped in regal robes, and borne in
pompous procession from her nursery into the church
where Cardinal Beton placed the royal crown upon her
baby brow, and her little fingers were made to clasp the
sceptre of state, and she was girded with the famous
sword which had been borne by so many warlike monarchs
of Scotland. And while prelates and peers knelt before
the tiny queen in solemn reverence, and royal princes
esteemed it an august honor to kiss her baby cheek, the
terrified infant, frightened by all these strange rough men
around her, wept. Poor baby queen! She began her
reign in tears and ended it upon the scaffold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>When Mary Stuart was five years of age she was betrothed
to the Dauphin of France, afterwards Francis II.,
and when she was six years old she was sent to France to
be educated. She was at this time remarkable for her
exquisite loveliness of form and feature and precocious
intellect. Four young Scotch girls of high rank had
accompanied the tiny queen from her native land, and as
they were all named Mary, they were known as the
“Queen’s Maries.” These Scottish maidens were Mary
Beton, Mary Seton, Mary Livingston, and Mary Fleming.
When in after years one after another of these Maries
married and left her service, they were replaced by others
bearing the same name, as it was a fancy of the queen
always to have four Maries attending her.</p>

<p>Mary astonished the court of France and all the foreign
ambassadors there assembled, when only twelve years of
age, by reciting with grace and dignity a Latin oration of
her own composition, before the king and a distinguished
company. Her essay, written in the style of Cicero, was
a plea in behalf of the “capacity of females for the highest
mental acquirements in literature and the fine arts.”</p>

<p>So beautiful was the young queen at this time that,
when on Palm Sunday she, with all the princesses and
ladies of the court of France, was carrying a palm branch
from church, a woman in the crowd was so dazzled with
the beauty and heavenly expression of Mary’s face, that
she knelt at the feet of the child in rapturous admiration,
exclaiming, “Are you not indeed an angel?”</p>

<p>A portrait of Mary Stuart, formerly in the royal gallery
at Fontainebleau, represents her in her fourteenth year.
“The color of her hair and eyes which has been as much
disputed as the question of her guilt or innocence, is of
that rich tint of brown called by the French chestnut; so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
are her beautiful eyebrows. Her complexion is clear and
delicate, but somewhat pale, her nose straight, and her
features lovely, refined, and intellectual. She wears a
white satin Scotch cap, placed very low on one side of her
head, with a rosette of white ostrich feathers, having in
the centre a ruby brooch, round which is wrought in gold
letters <i>Mariæ Reginæ Scotorum</i>. From this depends a
drooping plume formed of small pendant pearls. Her
dress is of white damask, fitting closely to her shape, with
a small partlet ruff of scalloped point lace, supported by a
collar of sapphires and rubies; a girdle of gems to correspond
encircles her waist. The dress is made without
plaits, gradually widening towards the feet in the shape
of a bell, and is fastened down the front with medallions
of pearls and precious stones. A royal mantle of pure
white is attached to the shoulders of her dress, trimmed
with point lace. Her sleeves are rather full, parted with
strings of pearls, and finished with small ruffles and jewelled
bracelets. Her hands are exquisitely formed. She
rests one on the back of a crimson velvet fauteuil, emblazoned
with the royal <i>fleurs-de-lys;</i> in the other she
holds an embroidered handkerchief. The arms of Scotland,
singly, are displayed in a maiden lozenge on the
wall above her, for Mary was not yet <i>la Reine Dauphine</i>.
She was at that time caressingly called by Catherine de’
Medici and the royal children of France, <i>notre petite Reinette
d’Escosse</i>, and was the pet and idol of the glittering
court of Valois. ‘Our petite Reinette Escossaise,’ said
Catherine de’ Medici, ‘has but to smile to turn the heads
of all Frenchmen.’”</p>

<p>When Mary Stuart was in her sixteenth year she was
married to the Dauphin, Francis, who was then fifteen
years of age. The nuptial ceremonies and festivities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
were magnificent in the extreme. Never had the famous
portals of Nôtre Dame received so lovely a bride. Her
appearance is thus described:—</p>

<p>“She was dressed in a robe whiter than the lily, but
so glorious in its fashion and decorations, that it would
be difficult, nay impossible, for any pen to do justice to
its details. Her regal mantle and train were of bluish-grey
cut velvet, richly embroidered with white silk and
pearls. It was of a marvellous length, full six toises,
covered with precious stones, and was supported by
young ladies. Mary wore a royal crown on this occasion
far more costly than any previous Scottish monarch could
ever boast, composed of the finest gold and most exquisite
workmanship, set with diamonds, pearls, rubies,
and emeralds of inestimable worth, having in the centre
a pendent stone computed at five hundred thousand
crowns. About her neck hung a matchless jewel, suspended
by chains of precious stones, which, from its
description, must have been none other than that well
known in Scottish records by the familiar name of the
<i>Great Harry</i>. This was her own personal property, derived
from her royal English great-grandfather, Henry
VII., by whom it was presented to her grandmother,
Queen Margaret Tudor.” Nôtre Dame blazed with lights,
dazzling jewels, and <i>grande toilettes</i>. As the ceremony
was concluded, Mary greeted her husband as Francis I.,
king of Scotland; and all the Scottish nobles bent in
homage to him. Handfuls of gold and silver coin were
then thrown in the midst of the assembled crowds of
people, while French heralds proclaimed the marriage,
and cried, “Largesse, largesse!” and the royal couple
received the titles of “Queen-Dauphiness,” and “The
King Dauphin.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Magnificent banquets, gorgeous balls, and splendid
pageants succeeded the marriage ceremonies in the
church. The royal palace was decorated with superb
splendor and regal lavishness of display. At the grand
ball the beautiful bride, the dazzling queen of Scotland,
danced the stately pavon,—a kind of minuet, which was
performed by ladies alone. As her train was twelve
yards long, and was borne after her by a gentleman, following
her in the dance, it was a difficult exercise of
grace and skill for the young bride to achieve. After the
dance, a novel pageant took place in the grand <i>salon</i>.
Suddenly there issued from the Chamber of Requests six
gallant ships, with sails of silver gauze fastened to silver
masts. Seated on the deck of each vessel, which was
propelled by artificial means, was a prince attired in
cloth of gold. Each handsome prince wore a mask; and
as the ship sailed by the groups of ladies, the chivalrous
knight seized a maiden and placed her on the gorgeous
throne beside him. In this exciting game the Dauphin
caught his bride, the lovely Mary Stuart. But Prince de
Condé, champion of the Huguenots, caused great merriment
by capturing, as his lady, the wife of his opponent
of Romish faith, the Duke de Guise.</p>

<p>The death of Mary I., queen of England, in 1558,
opened the way for the fatal step of Henry II. of France,
regarding his royal daughter-in-law, the queen of Scotland.
At a grand tournament held in honor of the marriage
of Elizabeth of France with Philip II. of Spain,
Mary, queen of Scotland, was borne to her place in the
royal balcony on a kind of triumphal car, emblazoned
with the royal escutcheon of England and Scotland, while
she was preceded by heralds who cried, “<i>Place! place!
pour la Reine d’Angleterre!</i>” And as the people took up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the cry, “<i>Vive la Reine d’Angleterre!</i>” they little imagined
that they were sounding the death-knell of the lovely
wife of their dauphin, whom they all adored. It was the
assumption of this title at this time which, twenty-seven
years afterwards, cost Mary Stuart her life.</p>

<p>But marriage pageants, funeral obsequies, and coronations
followed each other in quick succession. At the
very marriage tournament when Henry II. of France had
caused his royal daughter-in-law to be proclaimed queen
of England, he met with an accident which resulted in his
death. Mary’s husband was thereupon crowned king as
Francis II. of France. But in less than a year after his
coronation, Francis breathed his last, and the beautiful
Scottish queen was left a widow. That Mary Stuart was
a devoted wife to her French husband, all concede; and
Charles IX., brother of Francis, has left this pathetic
testimony to her worth. Whenever Charles IX. looked
upon Mary’s portrait, he would exclaim: “Ah, Francis!
happy brother! Though your life and reign were so
short, you were to be envied in this,—that you were the
possessor of that angel and the object of her love!”</p>

<p>Mary, Queen of Scots, returned to her native land after
the death of her husband, Francis II., and at this point
Elizabeth’s injustice begins. Mary sent a courteous request
to the queen of England, that she should be allowed to
pass to her own kingdom through her cousin’s domains;
but this was ungraciously refused. After Mary, Queen of
Scots, reached Scotland and assumed royal power there,
she was immediately beset by suitors for her hand. The
King of Sweden, Philip II. of Spain, and the Archduke
Charles, son of the Emperor of Germany, all sued for her
hand,—the former and latter in their own behalf, while
Philip of Spain desired an alliance between Mary and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
heir, Don Carlos. As these three princes had been previous
suitors to the English queen, Elizabeth never forgave
the insult, and vented all her spite of wounded vanity upon
the poor Queen of Scots. Then followed the schemes and
intrigues regarding the marriage of the Scottish queen;
Elizabeth claiming that she had no right to marry any one
whom she (Elizabeth) did not approve. At length Mary
took the matter into her own hands; and being really in
love with the handsome Darnley, her cousin,—who had
thus far veiled his weak and vicious nature beneath his
courtly manners and attractive face,—this unfortunate
marriage was consummated, and Mary Stuart became the
hapless victim of her many enemies.</p>

<p>We cannot recount the details of the many trials
heaped upon her by her weak and unworthy husband and
his intriguing father, joined with Scottish noblemen, who
desired her ruin because she was a Catholic. These earls
were not actuated by any fervent zeal in upholding the
Protestant religion; but as Scotland was then professedly
a Protestant nation, these wily nobles used the prevailing
opinions of the people to further their own ambitious
schemes. And in denouncing Mary as a Catholic, and
urging that she be dethroned, that her infant son might
be declared king, they were simply endeavoring to grasp
the reins of government with their own hands. These
Scottish noblemen were leagued with the English court;
but Bothwell headed another faction, which explains the
seeming difficulty in regard to her being still imprisoned
by the very party who rescued her from Bothwell’s power,
and from whom she was obliged to flee to England, to seek
the promised protection of the English queen.</p>

<p>With her last dying breath, Queen Elizabeth, perchance
unwittingly, substantiated her own treachery, or that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the English cabinet, and acknowledged the rights of
Mary, Queen of Scots. When urged to name her successor,
she said, “My seat has been the seat of kings, and
I will have <i>no rascal</i> to succeed me.” Secretary Cecil
ventured to ask her what she meant by those significant
words; to which she replied,—thereby intimating that all
who were not royal princes were <i>perforce rascals</i>,—“I will
be succeeded by a king, and who should that be but the
<i>King of Scots</i>.”</p>

<p>In spite of the subtle schemes and wily plotting of the
most cunning, keen-witted, and unscrupulous courtiers of
those wide-awake and intellectually progressive times, all
of them bent upon the destruction of one helpless, imprisoned
woman, whose very charms and fascinations and
confiding faith in good rather than evil motives, were
used by them as the very evidence to convict her of infamous
guilt;—whereas, these traits of character are the
strongest proof of her innocence;—in spite of all their
evil machinations, aided by the jealous vanity of a queen
who in other respects evinced a strong mind, and whose
reign is regarded as one of the brightest epochs in the
world’s history; in spite of all these overwhelming forces
conspiring to defame and destroy the hapless Queen of
Scots, nevertheless, our higher instincts of humanity
intuitively plead for the innocence of this unfortunate
Queen Mary, even though, by that very conclusion, we
must perforce tarnish the glory of the illustrious Queen
of England. For Elizabeth’s acknowledged defects of
character harmonize more strongly with such a supposition,
than that we should, without violence to our better
intuitions, allow that it could be consistent to link with
infamy and crime Mary’s equally acknowledged loveliness
and kindliness of nature, and devout constancy to what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
<i>she</i> felt to be vital points in her Christian faith, while at
the same time she allowed the most generous liberality of
belief to others. For of Mary, Queen of Scots, alone it
could be said, what no other sovereign of those days
could claim, that she never permitted persecution for religious
differences.</p>

<p>That Elizabeth could be dissembling and treacherous
when actuated by her weak, jealous vanity, all historians
fully prove and frankly acknowledge; that Elizabeth
scrupled not even at the death of her former friends,
when her petty spite was kindled against them, other
instances, such as the execution of the Earl of Essex,
whom without doubt Elizabeth loved, yet in a fit of anger
condemned to death, most clearly demonstrate. But that
Mary, Queen of Scots, could display such traits of character,
as all testimony, whether that of friends or foes,
are forced to concede to her through long years of imprisonment,
while still at heart she was the infamous
spirit of evil which her accusers have declared her to be,—a
very devil clothed in the likeness of an angel of Paradise,—is
against all experiences of human nature, against
all analogous instances in history.</p>

<p>The question of Mary Stuart’s guilt or innocence regarding
the murder of Darnley and willing marriage with
Bothwell, is one thing; but the question of Mary Stuart’s
political intrigues with Elizabeth’s enemies is entirely
another thing. As regards Mary Stuart’s connivance
with her Catholic party during her long imprisonment in
England, it is not necessary that she should be proven
innocent of such charges to insure her innocence of the
horrible infamy regarding the murder of Darnley and
willing marriage with his murderer. Were she guilty of
these nefarious crimes, all others however black and villanous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
would be probable. But her innocence regarding
those bloody deeds would not be impeached by political intrigues
to obtain her rightful liberty. Political scheming
was the governmental policy of the times, and he or she
who could be the most wily and intriguing <i>diplomate</i> was
looked upon as one who had achieved the greatest stroke
of genius. Surely in this business none were such adepts
as Elizabeth. That Mary Stuart would plot in behalf of
her Catholic belief would not prove that she was capable
of the vilest crimes. And though one should frankly
acknowledge that the death of Mary, Queen of Scots, was
an advantage to the cause of Protestantism, by weakening
Catholicism in Scotland and England, it would not
consequently be necessary to prove that her death was
the evidence of any crime on her part, save the insatiate
thirst for power, and consequent scheming and plotting
therefor, of which none of the sovereigns of her time
could be said to be guiltless.</p>

<p>Three things are asserted by those who condemn Mary,
Queen of the Scots: that she was guilty of murder, and
the vilest crimes of which a woman’s nature can be accused;
that she was guilty of political intrigues as a
Catholic fanatic in behalf of her Roman faith; or that
she was without any religious belief, merely employing
religion as a cloak to her crimes. Now, of course, if she
were guilty of the first accusation, no one could attempt
to deny the others; but though she were guilty of both the
last accusations, it would not imply that, therefore, she
was necessarily guilty of murder and revolting pollution.</p>

<p>The historians who defend Mary, Queen of Scots, claim
that she was innocent, not only of connivance at murder
and infamous vice, but that she was also free from all
political intrigues, either in defence of her ambitious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
greed for power, or in upholding her religious fanaticism;
while the historians who denounce Mary Stuart declare
that she was guilty of all and every crime, both as wife,
woman, and fanatic intriguer. From a close comparison
of given evidence on both sides, the truth would seem to
lie between them; for the proofs seem the stronger which
free Mary, Queen of Scots, of connivance at murder, and
vile pollution, while probabilities lean toward the supposition
that she knew of, if she did not indeed encourage,
plots amongst the enemies of England; but as she was
unjustly imprisoned by the English, this was only political
scheming; and though it might cost her her head,
from political expediency, it is no proof at all that she
was therefore guilty also of the most shocking and inexpiable
corruption. The plea of that <i>political expediency</i>
would of course remove infamy from the English cabinet
and their sovereign, as regards the one act of decapitating
their dangerous prisoner; but at the same time, the
same plea of political expediency would excuse the plotting
of Mary, Queen of Scots, while her substantiated
innocence of the viler and more heinous crimes brought
against her character as a wife and a woman, would at
the same time heap upon the English government and
Elizabeth the deepest and most demoniacal infamy, in
conniving at such atrocious and brutal lies against the
character and purity of a helpless woman, that they
might strengthen their political schemes against her life.</p>

<p>The question of the effect of her downfall upon the
world, as regards the upholding of Protestantism, and the
check to the onrush of inquisitorial Catholicism, is a very
different matter from the question regarding her innocence
as a wife and a woman.</p>

<p>That her downfall strengthened Protestantism will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
conceded; and that her death from political expediency
might have been required may not be denied; which
concession would not blot out the treachery of Elizabeth
and her ministers, nor would it involve the acknowledgment
of Mary Stuart’s guilt of aught save political plotting,
which, had she been the <i>queen</i> on the <i>throne</i> rather
than the <i>queen</i> in the <i>prison</i>, would have been looked
upon as justifiable strategy.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the quarrel of Henry VIII. with
the Pope and Romish Church was a great factor in the
glorious struggle for religious liberty, and the strengthening
of the power of the Reformation, which has filled not
only Europe, but the world, with the effulgent light of a
broader Christian civilization. But God can make the
“very wrath of man to praise him,” and because Henry
VIII. was an unconscious and unwilling instrument in the
hands of the Almighty, the praise is not to the wicked
king, but to an overruling Providence.</p>

<p>If Mary Stuart died for her religion, even though that
faith was Catholicism, Protestantism must not fanatically
refuse her the martyr’s crown. But if Mary Stuart and
Elizabeth were both women utterly devoid of religious
principle,—and this Elizabeth’s warmest admirers declare
concerning herself, as well as Mary Stuart,—then were
these two women engaged in one of the most subtle,
ingenious, and well-matched political games which was
ever played upon the stage of history; and in this game,
Elizabeth showed herself to be the most cunning schemer
who ever wore a victor’s crown, while Mary Stuart displayed
the most heroic and unconquerable fortitude ever
evinced by dying gladiator when vanquished in the Roman
amphitheatre.</p>

<p>Unless volumes were written upon the subject, it would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
be an impossibility to give a clear recital of the statements
made by the partisans and defamers of Mary
Stuart. According to one side, the famous “Silver-casket
Letters” are proved by acts of the Scottish
Parliament and many eminent authorities to have been
forgeries; and the whole scheme of Rizzio’s and Darnley’s
murder to have been concocted in the English cabinet.
According to other acts of Parliament and other
eminent authorities, the famous “Silver-casket Letters”
are pronounced genuine and convincing proofs of Mary’s
guilt of conniving at Darnley’s murder, and most shamelessly
marrying his murderer.</p>

<p>Now if the “Casket Letters” are genuine, there indeed
remains no doubt of Mary’s guilt. But if the act of the
Scottish Parliament, framed Dec. 20, 1567, for Bothwell’s
forfeiture, which act of Parliament was signed by James
Makgill, clerk-register (and which document, it is stated,
may be consulted in the register-house, Edinburgh, in the
original Latin), be genuine, the “Casket Letters” must
be spurious, and Mary’s innocence would be proved. It is
only upon these “Silver-casket Letters” that her defamers
rest the most important proof of her abetting Darnley’s
death and marrying Bothwell <i>willingly</i>, knowing that he
was her husband’s murderer. In these forged letters,
Mary is made to plan with Bothwell the death of Darnley,
and her own abduction with a man who had not yet procured
a divorce from his wife, whom only six months
before he had married with the queen’s most open consent.</p>

<p>This act of Parliament for the forfeiture of Bothwell
and sixty-four of his accomplices, after reciting his murder
of the “late King Henry,” proceeds in these words:
“And also for their treasonable interception of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
noble person of our most illustrious mother, Mary, Queen
of Scots, on her way from Linlithgow to the town of Edinburgh,
near the bridges vulgarly called ‘Foul Bridges,’
besetting her with a thousand armed men, equipped in
manner of war, in the month of April last. She suspecting
no evil from any of her subjects, and least of all
from the Earl of Bothwell, toward whom she had shown
as great offers of liberality and benevolence as prince
could show to good subject,—he by force and violence
treasonably seized her most noble person; put violent
hands upon her, not permitting her to enter her own town
of Edinburgh in peace, but carried her away that same
night to the Castle of Dunbar, against her will; and there
detained her as his prisoner for about twelve days.”</p>

<p>This act of Parliament, after specifying the nefarious
crime committed against her, in more explicit language,
recites: “That, after detaining Queen Mary’s most noble
person by force and violence twelve days, or thereabouts,
at Dunbar Castle, Bothwell compelled her by fear, under
circumstances such as might befall the most courageous
woman in the world, to promise that she would as soon as
possible contract marriage with him,—all which things
were plotted and planned by the said earl and the persons
aforesaid, of long time before, even before their aforesaid
conspiracy and parricide (the murder of Darnley), notwithstanding
that at the same time James, Earl of Bothwell,
was bound in marriage to an honorable lady, Janet
Gordon, from whom not only was he not divorced, but
no process of divorce was begun. And in his nefarious
and treasonable crimes and purposes continuing and persevering,
he kept and detained the most noble person of
our said dearest mother in firm custody and durance, by
force and <i>masterful</i> hand of his armed friends and dependants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
until the sixth day of May last past; on which day,
still accompanied by a great number of armed men, he
carried her to the Castle of Edinburgh, which was then in
his power, and there imprisoned her, and compelled her
to remain until the eleventh of the said month, on which
day, still accompanied by a great number of armed men,
that he might better color his treasonable and nefarious
crimes and purposes, he carried her to our palace of Holyrood,
and so within four days compelled her to contract
marriage with him.”</p>

<p>Regarding this act of Parliament, Agnes Strickland,
the English historian, says: “The facts chronicled in the
parliamentary record, which are officially attested by the
signature of James Makgill of Rankeillour, the clerk-register,
demonstrate at once the falsehood of his patron,
the Earl of Murray’s journal, of Buchanan’s ‘Detection’
and history of Mary’s reign, of the absurd paper
published by Murray under the name of ‘French Paris’s
Second Confession,’ and the supposititious letters produced
by Morton for the defamation of the queen. These
are all refuted by the act of Parliament, which asserts the
treasonable constraint that was put on the queen’s will;
and that act, be it remembered, was framed, and more
than that, proclaimed by the heralds in the ears of the
people, six months after the date assigned by Morton to
the discovery of the letters which he produced as evidences
of a guilty collusion and correspondence between
the queen and Bothwell. The act was framed within
seven months after the offence was perpetrated; and it
behooved to be correct, because several persons assisted
in that Parliament, as Huntley, Lethington, Sir James
Melville, and others, who were not only present when the
abduction was effected, but were carried away with their
royal mistress as prisoners to Dunbar.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Now let it be remembered that these witnesses for her
innocence were, with the exception of the faithful Sir
James Melville, and perhaps one or two others, no friends
of Mary, Queen of Scots, but were the very parties in
league with the English cabinet for her overthrow;
and as Bothwell was not in this league, but was plotting
only for his own scheme of being raised to the throne by
marriage with Mary Stuart, these framers of this act of
Parliament, exonerating Mary and denouncing Bothwell,
were not acting through favor of her; and therefore this
strong and overwhelming evidence comes from her very
foes.</p>

<p>The following letter is from Mary Stuart to the Pope
when she was at last out of the power of Bothwell. This
letter is from the collection of Prince Labanoff: “<i>Lettres de
Marie Stuart</i>, from the Secret Archives of the Vatican at
Rome,”—and will reveal Mary’s feelings on the subject:
“Tell to his Holiness,” writes she to her accredited envoy,
“the grief we suffered when we were made prisoner by
one of our subjects, the Earl of Bothwell, and led as
prisoner with the Earl of Huntley the Chancellor, and the
nobleman, our Secretary, together to the Castle of Dunbar,
and after to the Castle of Edinburgh, where we were
detained against our will in the hands of the said Earl of
Bothwell, until such time as he had procured a pretended
divorce between him and the sister of the said Lord of
Huntley, his wife, our near relative; and we were constrained
to yield our consent, yet against our will, to him.
Therefore your Holiness is supplicated to take order on
this, that we are made quit of the said indignity by means
of a process at Rome, and commission sent to Scotland,
to the bishops and other Catholic judges as your Holiness
seemeth best.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, Mr. Froude, the English historian,
does not refute this act of Parliament, but as evidence of
Mary’s guilt, which he most vehemently declares, cites
another act of Parliament, and states the following:—</p>

<p>“The Parliament met on the 15th of December. A
series of acts embodying the resolutions of the Council
were prepared by the Lords of the Articles,—among
them were Huntley and Argyle. The abdication of Lochleven,
the coronation of James, and the regency of
Murray were successively declared to have been lawful;
and lastly, in an act ‘anent the retention of their sovereign
Lord’s mother’s person,’ the genuineness of the
evidence by which her share in the murder was proved
was accepted as beyond doubt or question.</p>

<p>“When the measure was laid before Parliament, Lord
Herries, with one or two others, protested, not against
the truth of the charges, but ‘against an act which was
prejudicial to the honor, power, and estate of the Queen.’
But their objections were overruled. The acts were
passed; the last and most important declaring that ‘the
taking of arms by the lords and barons, the apprehension
of the queen’s person, and generally all other things
spoken and done by them to that effect, since the 10th of
February last period, were caused by the said queen’s
own default.’ It was most certain, from divers her privy
letters, written wholly with her own hand, to the Earl of
Bothwell, and by her ungodly and dishonorable proceeding
to a pretended marriage with him, that she was privy
art and part of the device and deed of the murder, and
therefore justly deserved whatever had been done to her.
Indirect counsel and means had been used to hold back
the knowledge of the truth, yet all men were fully persuaded
in their hearts of the authors and devisers of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
fact. The nobility perceiving the queen so thrall and so
blindly affectionate to the tyrant, and perceiving also that
both he and she had conspired together such horrible
cruelty, they had at length taken up arms to punish them.”</p>

<p>Surely both of these acts of Parliament cannot be trustworthy.
Froude refers to Anderson’s Collection as his
authority; Miss Strickland, to the register-house, Edinburgh,
where the act may be seen in the original Latin.
According to one, Mary, Queen of Scots is most clearly
proven innocent; according to the other, Mary is most
clearly proven guilty. The question therefore rests on
the validity of the two acts. The reader may choose between
them.</p>

<p>Regarding the famous “Silver-casket Letters,” these
two English authorities thus comment. Miss Strickland
says: “Several hundreds of Mary Stuart’s genuine letters
are now before the public, commencing with those she
wrote to her mother in her artless childhood. Not one of
these bears the slightest analogy, either in style, sentiment
or diction, with the eight suspicious documents she
is alleged to have written. But argument is rendered
unnecessary by the fact that the discovery of letters so
discrepant with anything ever written, ever said or done,
by Mary Stuart, rests solely on the testimony of Morton,
one of the conspirators in the murder of Darnley. Prince
Labanoff, who has devoted his life to the collection and
verification of Mary Stuart’s letters, rejects this supposititious
series, because, as he briefly observes, ‘there is
nothing to prove their authenticity’; while the elder
Tytler, who, as a lord of session, or judge, had been
accustomed to study and collate evidences in the criminal
courts of Scotland, has written two able volumes to expose
their fallacies, under the title of ‘A Critical Enquiry
into the Evidences.’”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Henry, the historian of England and Scotland,
gave his private and most impartial opinion on this controversy
in a letter to William Tytler, printed in “Transactions
of Scottish Antiquarian Society,” in these words:
“I have been long convinced that the unfortunate Queen
Mary was basely betrayed and cruelly oppressed during
her life, and calumniated after her death. Many things
contributed to involve her in difficulties and dangers on
her return to Scotland; her invincible adherence to her
religion, her implicit submission to the dictates of her
French friends, her having roused the jealousy of
Elizabeth by assuming the English arms, the ambition of
her brother James, and the faithless, plotting characters
of others near her person,—in a word, an invisible political
net seemed to have been spread around her, from
which it was hardly possible for her to escape. Your
efforts, sir, to relieve the memory of a much injured
princess from a load of calumny are generous and commendable,
and I can assure you they have not been
unsuccessful. There is a great and general change in the
sentiments of the public on that subject. He would be
a bold man who should publish a history of Queen Mary
now in the same strain with our two late historians,—Malcolm
Laing and Robertson, whose sophistries were
rightly estimated by that clear-headed and honest historian,
Dr. Henry. Dr. Johnson, a person of a very
different way of thinking from either, pronounced a most
decided opinion in favor of Mary’s innocence, and expressed
his firm conviction ‘that the Silver-casket Letters
were spurious, and would never again be brought forward
as historic evidences.’”</p>

<p>Regarding these same “Silver-casket Letters,” Froude
says: “These letters were found in the celebrated casket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
with the others to which reference was made in the preceding
volume; I accept them as genuine, because, as will
be seen, they were submitted to the scrutiny of almost
the entire English peerage, and especially to those among
the peers who were most interested in discovering them
to be forged, and by them admitted to be indisputably in
the handwriting of the Queen of Scots; because the
letters in the text especially refer to conversations with
Lord Huntley, who was then and always one of Mary
Stuart’s truest adherents,—conversations which he could
have denied had they been false, and which he never did
deny; because their contents were confirmed in every
particular unfavorable to the queen by a Catholic informant
of the Spanish ambassador, who hurried from
the spot to London immediately after the final catastrophe
for which they prepared the way; and lastly, because
there is no ground whatever to doubt the genuineness of
the entire set of the casket-letters, except such as arises
from the hardy and long-continued but entirely baseless
denial of interested or sentimental partisans.”</p>

<p>But in connection with Mr. Froude’s declaration that
his faith rests on them because they were submitted to
the <i>English Peerage</i>, impartial statement of evidence
demands another comparison between these conflicting
testimonies upon a different link in the chain of evidence
for and against the guilt of Mary Stuart. Randolph was
the English ambassador at the court of Scotland, and in
some of his letters to Leicester he has revealed the English
plotting and connivance in the scheme to ruin Mary,
Queen of Scots. Regarding this point Miss Strickland
says:—</p>

<p>“In the selfsame letter which records the round of
banquets, masks, and princely pleasures, the English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
Mephistopheles, Randolph, exultingly unfolds to Leicester
the items of the black budget prepared with his approval,
against the meeting of the Scottish Parliament,
by the unscrupulous coalition of traitors who were secretly
allied with their sovereign’s husband and his father in a
dastardly bond for murder, premeditated in cold blood,
and intended to be perpetrated in the presence of their
queen; and the crime was to be justified, as such deeds
generally are, by slander.</p>

<p>“‘I know now for certain,’ writes he, ‘that this queen
repenteth her marriage,—that she hateth him and all his
kin. I know that he knoweth himself that he hath a
partner in play and game with him. I know that there
are practices in hand, contrived between the father and
the son, to come by the crown against her will. I know
that if it take effect, which is intended, David, with the
consent of the king, shall have his throat cut within
these ten days. Many thing <i>grieveouser</i>, and worse than
these are brought to my ears, yea, of things <i>intended
against her own person</i>, which, because I think better to
keep secret than to write to Mr. Secretary, I speak not of
them, but now to your lordship.’ By one of the secret
articles of the atrocious pact to which our worthy ambassador
alludes, the life-long imprisonment of Mary was
agreed, and her death, in case of her attempting to resist
the transfer of the whole power of the crown to the ungrateful
consort she had associated in her regality; and to this
wrong Cecil, Bedford, and Elizabeth tacitly consented.”</p>

<p>Such was the villanous treachery of Darnley and his
father, leagued with the English ministers and malcontents
in Scotland, headed by Murray, the plotting half-brother
of the queen, against Mary Stuart, who time and
again received her inconstant and petulant husband into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
favor, forgiving his outrageous behavior towards her.
But Darnley little knew the schemes of his vile fellow-conspirators.
They but used him as a tool, as long as he
could avail their purposes, and then blew him up with
gunpowder, when they had matured their infamous plans,
so that his death should seemingly be the work of his
shamefully abused and marvellously forbearing wife.</p>

<p>Miss Strickland further says:—</p>

<p>“A startling light is thrown by a careful collation of
the above letters of Randolph to Leicester and Throckmorton
on the agency, as well as the incentives, employed
in the successive Edinburgh assassinations of
Mary Stuart’s faithful and incorruptible minister, David
Rizzio, in March, 1566, and that of her husband in February,
1567, which led to the deposition of that unfortunate
princess and the transfer of the government of
Scotland to the sworn creatures of the English sovereign,
a <i>great</i> but <i>diabolical stroke of policy</i>. The cool revelation
of our unscrupulous ambassador, that the faithful
minister who would not barter his royal mistress’s interests
for English gold, ‘would have his throat cut
within ten days,’ is sufficient proof of his iniquitous
coalition in the murderous confederacy against the first
victim of the English cabinet. His hostile expressions
regarding Mary’s husband, with whom he was at that
very moment enleagued in the secret intrigues for obtaining
the signatures of Murray and the banished lords
to the bond for the murder of Rizzio, are no less worthy
of observation, together with his earnest deprecation of
Mary and her husband ever succeeding to the throne of
England, and the emphatic desire he expressed to Throckmorton
that ‘<i>something may be done to preclude the possibility
of such a contingency</i>.’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>“This subtle diplomatist first excited and then worked
on the natural fears of better men than either himself,
Leicester, or Throckmorton, to wink at, if not to sanction,
the systematic train of political villany to which David
Rizzio, Henry Stuart, and Mary Stuart were the successive
victims. After the consummation of these astute
schemes of wickedness—when Rizzio and Darnley were
festering in their untimely graves, and the more pitiable
survivor, Mary Stuart, languishing in her damp, noisome
prison-room in Tutbury Castle, her infant son set up as
a puppet king, to color the usurpation of the murderers
of his father and her defamers, and her realm convulsed
with civil strife—‘then,’ observes Sir James Melville, ‘as
Nero stood upon a high part of Rome to see the town
burning, which he had caused to be set on fire, so Master
Randolph delighted to see such fire kindled in Scotland,
and by his writings to some in the court of England,
glorified himself to have brought it to pass in such sort
that it could not be easily <i>slokened</i> (slaked) again.’”</p>

<p>In proof of the importance of this link in the chain of
evidence, we will quote Mr. Froude’s own words: “As
the vindication of the conduct of the English government
proceeds on the assumption of her guilt, so the determination
of her innocence will equally be the absolute
condemnation of Elizabeth and Elizabeth’s advisers.”</p>

<p>There is only one other point in this evidence for and
against the guilt of Mary Stuart, which will be cited.
Regarding the famous confessions of Paris, Mr. Froude
says:—</p>

<p>“Nicholas Hubert, <i>alias</i> French Paris, was Bothwell’s
page. He was taken privately to St. Andrews, where the
Regent happened to be, and examined by George Buchanan,
Robert Ramsey, Murray’s steward, and John<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Wood, his confidential secretary. Paris made two depositions:
the first not touching Mary Stuart, the second
fatally implicating her. This last was read over in his
presence. He signed it, and was then executed, that
there might be no retraction or contradiction.”</p>

<p>Regarding these confessions, Agnes Strickland says:—</p>

<p>“Nothing can, in fact, afford clearer evidence of Mary’s
ignorance of the plot of her husband’s murder than this
first confession of Hubert. Malcolm Laing, the most
able of all the writers who have adopted the self-interested
calumnies of the conspirators against Mary, put forth by
their venal organ, Buchanan, and the political agents of
Cecil, insists on the authenticity and credibility of this
document. It contains, indeed, such strong internal evidences
of reality that we fully coincide with him in its
being genuine evidence, and for this reason reject the so-called
second confession of Nicholas Hubert, or French
Paris, as spurious, because one or the other must be false,
and the second is palpably a fabrication between Murray
and his secretary, Alexander Hay, to bolster up the forged
letters and defame the queen. As poor Hubert could not
write, it was unlikely he could read the paper to which
Murray’s secretary made him put his mark. He had no
trial, and though Queen Elizabeth requested he might be
sent to London, Murray hanged him, that he might not
contradict what had been put forth in his name.”</p>

<p>We mention Agnes Strickland, in these comparisons
with the testimony of Froude, because she was also an
English writer; and she quotes from the very same
authorities, for nearly all of the historians, letters, state
papers, and authorities are cited by Miss Strickland which
are used by Froude in proof of his statements. We also
quote Agnes Strickland because her works are within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
reach of every one, and those desiring to investigate the
evidences on both sides will find her authorities in the
foot-notes of her “English and Scottish Queens,” and in
separate lives of Mary Stuart and Elizabeth, in her historical
series. It is not the authority of Agnes Strickland
as against that of Froude, but the weight of the many
authorities and state papers which both refer to, as evidence
in proof of the different sides they take upon this
perplexing question. Froude pronounces Mary Stuart as
probably innocent of all evil intent regarding Rizzio, and
exonerates her of any improper conduct with him further
than a good-natured condescension towards one in her
employ. But if Mary Stuart’s guilt with Bothwell is
proven, it is idle to talk of her innocence with Rizzio.</p>

<p>Mary Stuart was rescued from the power of the infamous
Bothwell, and he was obliged to flee the country,
and died in exile ten years after. But poor abused Mary
was not yet free from her enemies. The very men who
rescued her from Bothwell were leagued with England,
with the ambitious Murray at their head. Their plan was
now to get rid of the queen and get hold of the baby
prince, that they might in his name get possession of the
government. And with this scheme England and Elizabeth
were well pleased, forsooth, for by bribes and threats
the regent of the baby king could be held in England’s
power. As these nefarious schemers planned, so did they
execute. Queen Mary was apparently aided by them to
escape the power of Bothwell, but so cruelly was she
treated that it was but an exchange of jailors. Poor,
slandered, persecuted queen, thinking good of every one,
she was betrayed on every hand. Husband, father-in-law,
half-brother, Scottish ministers, and England’s courtiers,
incited by a jealous cousin-queen, all plotted and counter-plotted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
and wove the web so closely around her that there
was no escape. She was betrayed by one party, only to
find herself more cruelly betrayed by her supposed deliverers.</p>

<p>To whom could she turn? Elizabeth had treacherously
and hypocritically sympathized with her terrible woes.
Elizabeth was a woman, and a cousin, and a queen;
would she not succor her? and so the confiding heart of
Mary, Queen of Scots, thinking no evil of those who professed
kindness, fled to England and delivered herself
unwittingly into the hands of her very worst foe. The
poor fly now was entrapped, and the wily spider prepared
her final doom.</p>

<p>The captive Queen of Scots had been transferred from
prison to prison, each day more closely confined, each day
treated with less respect and greater cruelty. At length
Mary, Queen of Scots, was brought to trial and accused
of high treason. Mary Stuart had neither advocates,
counsel, nor documents; no one was allowed to plead for
her, but notwithstanding, for two days, the ablest lawyers
in England were held in check by her wit, skill, and marvellous
presence of mind. Mary demanded to be heard
by Parliament, and to be permitted to see the queen in
person. But this was denied her, and sentence of death
was passed upon her. It was at this time that Henry III.,
of France, endeavored to awaken in the heart of James
VI., of Scotland, some sentiments of regard for his helpless
mother. If the conduct of the King of Scotland
shocked the <i>son</i> of <i>Catherine de’ Medici</i>, what severer condemnation
of the unnatural treatment of James VI. can
be required?</p>

<p>Such is Guizot’s comment upon the treatment of the
young Scottish king towards his unfortunate mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
whose pitiable misfortunes roused many princes in Europe
to espouse her cause and endeavor to effect her freedom,
which efforts in the end proved most disastrous, as
they only brought down greater accusations upon her head.</p>

<p>Some writers do declare, however, that James VI., of
Scotland, did make some feeble efforts in her behalf,
which were quickly made unavailing through the wily cunning
of Elizabeth and her scheming ministers.</p>

<p>When her sentence was read to the hapless Queen of
Scots, Mary made the sign of the cross and calmly said
“that death was welcome, but that she had not expected
after having being detained twenty years in prison that
her sister Elizabeth would thus dispose of her.” At the
same time Mary placed her hand upon a book beside her,
and swore a solemn oath that she had never contemplated
nor sought the death of Elizabeth.</p>

<p>“That is a popish Bible,” exclaimed the Earl of Kent,
rudely; “your oath is of no value.”</p>

<p>“It is a Catholic testament,” said the queen with calm
dignity, “and therefore, my lord, as I believe that to be
the true version, my oath is the more to be relied on.”</p>

<p>Some writers claim that Elizabeth did not herself sign
the death-warrant of Mary, Queen of Scots, but tacitly
consenting thereto, her signature was at last forged by
one Thomas Harrison, a private and confidential secretary
of Sir Francis Walsingham. According to Elizabeth’s
secretary, Davison, the warrant had been ready for six
weeks when the queen signed it in private, consigning it
to the Secretary of State, Davison, “without other
orders,” as she afterwards declared. Regarding Harrison’s
confession, which did not come to light until twenty
years after Mary’s execution, it is stated that a document
was found, purporting to be a Star-Chamber investigation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
dated 1606. It is a deposition, attested by the signatures
of two persons of the names of Mayer and Macaw, affirming,
“that the late Thomas Harrison, a private and confidential
secretary of the late Sir Francis Walsingham,
did voluntarily acknowledge to them that, in conjunction
with Thomas Phillipps and Maude, he, by the direction of
his master, Sir Francis Walsingham, added to the letters
of the late queen of Scotland those passages that were
afterwards brought in evidence against her, and for which
she was condemned to suffer death; and that he was
employed by his said master, Sir Francis Walsingham, to
forge Queen Elizabeth’s signature to the death-warrant of
the Queen of Scots, which none of her ministers could
ever induce her to sign; and that he did this with the
knowledge and assent of four of her principal ministers
of state.”</p>

<p>Regarding this point, Miss Strickland, in her life of
Queen Elizabeth, says: “If she did not sign the warrant
for Mary’s execution,—and we have only Davison’s asseveration
in proof that she did,—then was her ignorance of
the consummation real, her tears and lamentations unaffected,
and her indignation against her ministers no
grimace.”</p>

<p>But were this the case, why did Elizabeth not clear her
own reputation from the stain of this infamous deed by
denouncing her unscrupulous ministers who had dared
thus tamper with her royal name and royal authority?
Miss Strickland claims that she could not, giving the reason
in these words: “The position in which her ministers
had placed Elizabeth, was the more painful because, unless
she could have brought them to a public trial, convicted
them of the treasonable crime of procuring her
royal signature to be forged, she could not explain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
offence of which they had been guilty. The impossibility
of proclaiming the whole truth, rendered her passionate
protestations of her own innocence not only unsatisfactory,
but apparently false and equivocating. While she
denied the deed, she was in a manner compelled to act as
if it were her own, being unable to inflict condign punishment
on the subtle junta who had combined to make unauthorized
use of her name for the immolation of the
heiress-presumptive of the crown.”</p>

<p>But if Elizabeth was innocent of the death of Mary,
Queen of Scots, it seems evident that with her imperious
nature, she would have most daringly and publicly resented
and punished such audacious villany. Had she in reality
desired the death of Mary, and yet refused to sign the
warrant, and had her name been forged upon it, this
would have given her the very opportunity to clear her
own name from infamy and the condemnation of the
powers of Europe, which she well knew this execution
would call forth; and yet the very end she dared to <i>wish
for</i>, if not to <i>command</i>, would have been accomplished,
and the blame would rest upon others rather than herself.</p>

<p>That Elizabeth desired the death of Mary all her previous
conduct would prove; and if that death was accomplished
at last through the crimes of others, unknown to
the queen of England, surely she could not have had a
better opportunity for proving her own innocence than
the denunciation of the treacherous ministers who had
committed the crime. That she denounced them it is
true; but the strength and manner of those denunciations
were more in keeping with the supposition that she was
hypocritically screening her own aid and connivance in
the treachery, than that they had dared commit so criminal
a villany as the forging of her own royal name, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
commission of so grave an offence upon the strength of
that forged signature.</p>

<p>At six o’clock on the fatal morning of the 8th of February,
1587, Mary Stuart told her ladies that “she had
but two hours to live, and bade them dress her as for a
festival.” The particulars of the last <i>toilette</i> have been
preserved. “She wore a widow’s dress of black velvet,
spangled over with gold, a black satin pourpoint and kirtle,
and under these a petticoat of crimson velvet, with a body
of the same color, and a white veil of the most delicate
texture, of the fashion worn by princesses of the highest
rank, thrown over her coif and descending to the ground.
She wore a pomander chain, and an <i>Agnus Dei</i> about her
neck, and a pair of beads at her girdle, with a cross.”</p>

<p>Mary Stuart had gained the reluctant consent of her
inhuman jailers, that her faithful ladies, Jane Kennedy
and Elizabeth Curie, should attend her in her last moments.
This had been stoutly refused at first, but the
eloquent exclamation of the royal captive, “I am cousin
to your queen, descended of the blood-royal of Henry VII.,
a married queen of France, and the anointed queen of
Scotland!” at length shamed them into granting this
last request.</p>

<p>When the still-beautiful, heroic Mary Stuart entered the
hall of death, followed by her faithful attendants, she
gazed upon the sable scaffold, the dread block, the gleaming
axe, and the revolting executioner, with calm and
undaunted courage, manifesting by her majestic and intrepid
demeanor, and the angelic sweetness of her countenance,
that in spite of calumny and hostile hosts of pitiless
foes, Mary, Queen of Scots could face the world and
death undismayed.</p>

<div class="caption">MARY STUART LED TO EXECUTION</div>

<div class="attrib2">Drawing by Gyula Benczur.</div>
</div>

<p>“Weep not, my good Melville!” said Mary Stuart to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the faithful servant who threw himself in a paroxysm of
grief at her feet. “Weep not for me! Thou shouldst
rather rejoice that thou shalt now see the end of the long
troubles of Mary Stuart; know, Melville, that this world
is but vanity and full of sorrows. I am Catholic, thou
Protestant, but as there is but one Christ, I charge thee
in His name to bear witness that I die firm to my religion,
a true Scotchwoman, and true to France. Commend me
to my dearest and most sweet son. Tell him I have done
nothing to prejudice him in his realm, nor to disparage
his dignity, and if he will live in the fear of God, I doubt
not he shall do well. Tell him, from my example, never
to rely too much on human aid, but to seek that which is
from above. If he follow my advice, he shall have the
blessing of God in heaven, as I now give him mine on
earth.”</p>

<p>As Mary Stuart ascended the steps of the scaffold, Sir
Amyas Paulet, her last jailer, tendered his hand to aid her.
With queenly courtesy she accepted it, saying: “I thank
you, sir; this is the last trouble I shall ever give you.”</p>

<p>When her upper garments had been removed, she remained
clothed in her petticoat of crimson velvet, with
bodice and sleeves of the same material. As Jane Kennedy
drew forth the gold-bordered handkerchief Mary
had given her to bind her eyes, the faithful lady could
not restrain her weeping. But Mary placed her finger
on her lips, saying tenderly: “Hush! I have promised
you would make no outcry; weep not, but pray for me.”</p>

<p>When the handkerchief was pinned over the eyes of
her loved mistress Jane was forced to retire, and Mary
Stuart was left alone upon the scaffold with her executioners.
Kneeling on the cushion, the heroic Queen of
Scots repeated with unfaltering voice: “<i>In te Domine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
speravi</i>” (In thee, Lord, have I hoped). As she was
blindfolded she was then led by the executioner to the
block, upon which she bowed her head without the least
hesitation, exclaiming in firm and clear tones, “<i>In manus
tuas</i>.” “Into thy hands, O Lord, I commend my spirit,”
and the beautiful lips closed forever. At the first blow
the agitated executioner missed his aim, and inflicted a
deep wound on the side of the skull. No groan nor cry
escaped the suffering victim, but the convulsion of her
features evinced her terrible pain. At the third blow the
“butcher work” was accomplished, and the beautiful head
of the hapless Queen of Scots, streaming with blood, was
held up to the gaze of the people, as holding aloft this
bloody and horrible trophy of his fiendish deed, the
executioner cried, “So perish all Queen Elizabeth’s
enemies!”</p>

<p>But neither wily ministers, nor plotting knaves, nor
jealous hate, nor obedient executioners, could rid Queen
Elizabeth of her last great foe, who, in spite of all her
schemes, and tears, and imprecations, would soon snatch
the royal diadem from her brow, and take the sceptre
from her clutching hands, and tear the royal ermine from
her tottering form, and close her defiant eyes. The King
of Terrors could neither be bribed, nor menaced, nor defeated,
though she should cry in tortured agony, “<i>My
kingdom for an hour of time!</i>” Steadily this conqueror
approached, though she fought desperately to elude his
grasp. Far differently did Elizabeth meet her doom from
the heroic Queen of Scots. Refusing to go to bed lest
she should be deemed dying, Elizabeth commanded that
pillows should be piled for her on the floor; and there,
writhing in agony of body and terror of mind, she spent
her last hours. Now calling upon her chaplain to pray,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
and then muttering in angry complainings when her
ministers requested her to name her successor. At length
she was so weak that she could no longer speak, and she
ordered by signs that the Archbishop of Canterbury should
continue to pray. This the old man did until he was
utterly exhausted, the dying queen each time motioning
him to proceed, when he endeavored to stop from very
weariness. Meanwhile her attendants watched her waning
breath, with eager impatience to greet the coming king.
But even in death their wily vigilance was overreached
by the apparent sleep of their helpless sovereign, and
Elizabeth had been dead several hours before it was discovered
by her scheming ministers, who were eagerly
awaiting the signal announcing her demise, that they
might be the first to shout “God save James I.! king of
England, Ireland and Scotland!”</p>

<p>Mr. Froude thus ably sums up the salient points in the
character and reign of Elizabeth:—</p>

<p>“The years which followed the defeat of the Armada
were rich in events of profound national importance.
They were years of splendor and triumph. The flag of
England became supreme on the seas; English commerce
penetrated to the farthest corners of the Old World,
and English colonies rooted themselves on the shores of
the New. The national intellect, strung by excitement
of sixty years, took shape in a literature which is an
eternal possession to mankind, while the incipient struggles
of the two parties in the Anglican church prepared
the way for the conflicts of the coming century, and the
second act of the Reformation. The Catholic England
with which the century opened, the England of dominant
church, and monasteries, and pilgrimages, became the
England of progressive intelligence; and the question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
whether the nation was to pass a second time through the
farce of a reconciliation with Rome was answered once
and forever by the cannon of Sir Francis Drake. The
action before Gravelines of the 30th of July, 1588, decided
the largest problems ever submitted in the history
of mankind to the arbitrement of force. Beyond and
beside the immediate fate of England, it decided that
Philip’s revolted provinces should never be reannexed to
the Spanish Crown. It broke the back of Spain, sealed
the fate of the Duke of Guise, and though it could not
prevent the civil war, it assured the ultimate succession
of the king of Navarre. In its remoter consequences it
determined the fate of the Reformation in Germany; for
had Philip been victorious the League must have been
immediately triumphant; the power of France would have
been on the side of Spain and the Jesuits, and the thirty
years’ war would either have never been begun, or would
have been brought to a swift conclusion. It furnished
James of Scotland with conclusive reasons for remaining
a Protestant, and for eschewing forever the forbidden
fruit of popery; and thus it secured his tranquil accession
to the throne of England when Elizabeth passed away.
Finally, it was the sermon which completed the conversion
of the English nation, and transformed the Catholics into
Anglicans.</p>

<p>“While Parliament was busy with the condition of the
people, the concerns of the Church were taken in hand by
the queen herself. For Protestantism Elizabeth had
never concealed her dislike and contempt. She hated to
acknowledge any fellowship in religion either with Scots,
Dutch, or Huguenots. She represented herself to foreign
ambassadors as a Catholic in everything, except in allegiance
to the papacy. Even for the Church of England, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
which she was the supreme governor, she affected no
particular respect.</p>

<p>“The want of wisdom shown in the persecution of the
Nonconformists was demonstrated by the event. Puritanism
was a living force in England; Catholicism was a
dying superstition. Puritanism had saved Elizabeth’s
crown; Catholicism was a hot-bed of disloyalty. She
found herself compelled against her will to become the
patron of heretics and rebels, in whose objects she had no
interest and in whose theology she had no belief. She
resented the necessity while she submitted to it, and her
vacillations are explained by the reluctance with which
each successive step was forced upon her on a road which
she detested. It would have been easy for a Protestant
to be decided. It would have been easy for a Catholic to
be decided. To Elizabeth the speculations of so-called
divines were but as ropes of sand and sea-slime leading to
the moon, and the doctrines for which they were rending
each other to pieces a dream of fools or enthusiasts.
Unfortunately her keenness of insight was not combined
with any profound concern for serious things. She saw
through the forms in which religion presented itself to the
world. She had none the more any larger or deeper conviction
of her own. She was without the intellectual emotions
which give human character its consistency and
power.</p>

<p>“Elizabeth could rarely bring herself to sign the death-warrant
of a nobleman, yet without compunction she
could order Yorkshire peasants to be hung in scores by
martial law. She was most remorseless when she ought
to have been most forbearing, and lenient when she ought
to have been stern.</p>

<p>“Vain as she was of her own sagacity, she never modified<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
a course recommended to her by Burleigh, without injury
both to the realm and to herself. The great results
of her reign were the fruits of a policy which was not her
own, and which she starved and mutilated when energy
and completeness were needed.</p>

<p>“The greatest achievement in English history, the
‘breaking the bonds of Rome,’ and the establishment of
spiritual independence, was completed without bloodshed
under Elizabeth’s auspices, and Elizabeth may have the
glory of the work.</p>

<p>“In fighting out her long quarrel with Spain and building
her church system out of the broken masonry of
popery, her concluding years passed away. The great
men who had upheld the throne in the days of her peril
dropped one by one into the grave. Walsingham died
soon after the defeat of the Armada, ruined in fortune
and weary of his ungrateful service. Hunsdon, Knollys,
Burleigh, Drake, followed at brief intervals, and their mistress
was left by herself, standing as it seemed on the pinnacle
of earthly glory, yet in all the loneliness of greatness,
and unable to enjoy the honors which Burleigh’s policy
had won for her. The first place among the Protestant
powers, which had been so often offered her and so often
refused, has been forced upon her in spite of herself. She
was head of the name, but it gave her no pleasure. She
was the last of her race; no Tudor would sit again on the
English throne. Her own sad prophecy was fulfilled, and
she lived to see those whom she most trusted turning
their eyes to the rising sun.</p>

<p>“Old age was coming upon her, bringing with it perhaps
a consciousness of failing faculties; and solitary in the
midst of splendor, and friendless among the circle of
adorers, who swore they lived but in her presence, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
grew weary of a life which had ceased to interest her.
Sickening of a vague disease, she sought no help from
medicine, and finally refused to take food. She could not
rest in her bed, but sat silent on cushions, staring into
vacancy with fixed and stony eyes, and so at last she
died.</p>

<p>“All questions connected with the virgin queen should
be rather studied in her actions than in the opinion of the
historian who relates them. <i>Opinions</i> are but forms of
cloud created by the prevailing currents of the moral air.
<i>Actions and words are carved upon eternity.</i>”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“WOE to thee, O country, that hast a child for
king!” exclaimed the Venetian ambassador in
France, in 1560, when Charles IX., a child ten years old,
ascended the throne; but greater woe to that country
because the mother of that child, who held the power of
government, as queen-regent, was one of the greatest
monsters of crime in the annals of history, and forced that
child to become a very fiend of infamy and cruelty.</p>

<div class="caption">CATHERINE DE’ MEDICI</div>

<div class="attrib2">Painting by François Clouet,<br>
Chantilly.</div>
</div>

<p>Catherine de’ Medici was a woman devoid of every
womanly instinct, every womanly virtue, every womanly
attribute. She was the very incarnation of the terrible
Medusa, petrifying all noble impulses, destroying all virtuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
aspirations, killing every kindly feeling in the hearts
of those around her.</p>

<p>She had been taught the doctrines of Machiavelli, whose
ideal of a prince was one who should work by force, fraud,
cruelty, and dissimulation to gain his desired ends; but
even these dangerous theories of that crafty, though brilliant-minded
Florentine, were far out-stripped in unprincipled
chicanery by his ambitious follower, Catherine de
Medici; so that the term Machiavellian is far too weak a
word to apply to her diabolical villanies.</p>

<p>France ran red with blood. The terrible tocsin at midnight
tolled forth the death-doom of one hundred thousand
lives. The wild shrieks of the dying freighted the
air of France with heart-curdling wailings from centre
to circumference. French soil was deluged with the
blood of her people. The blasphemous curses of the
fiendish murderers polluted the very air of heaven, until
it seemed as though the furies of hell were let loose
upon this realm, to wreck upon the helpless people the
infernal hate of the arch-demon himself.</p>

<p>Who was the diabolical instigator of this atrocious
work? Alas! a woman! and that woman <i>Catherine de’
Medici</i>.</p>

<p>The innocent soul of a child, naturally moved by good
impulses, was tutored in every vice of which human
nature is capable. His childish lips were taught to pronounce
the most terrible blasphemies, his kind heart was
mocked and sneered at, and tempted with every ensnaring
device of vile and polluting pleasures offered by the
most dissolute and alluring companions, until no wickedness
seemed too great to be undertaken, no degrading
diversion too low to be indulged in. His constitution
was purposely weakened, his mind purposely dwarfed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
debased, that his life might be short, and that his will
might be broken; that another’s ambitious power might
be increased even though it cost the death of body and
soul of the helpless victim. Who was this fiend incarnate,
who could thus toy with a human soul, hourly
dragging it nearer and nearer the yawning jaws of the
bottomless pit of perdition? That one was a woman, the
<i>mother</i> of her quivering victim; this malevolent Gorgon
was <i>Catherine de’ Medici</i>.</p>

<p>Even the horrors of the Inquisition in Spain pale before
the horrors of the massacre of St. Bartholomew. Even
the bloody “Demon of the South,” as Philip II. was
called, seems not such a revolting spectacle of depraved
humanity as Catherine de’ Medici; for Philip, at least,
fanatically imagined he was aiding the cause of religion,
as he believed the infamous Inquisition to be a righteous
avenger in behalf of the Catholic Church; whereas Catherine
de’ Medici had no belief, no religion, cared neither
for Catholics nor Protestants, neither for the Romish
Church nor for the Reformed Faith.</p>

<p>She flattered each by turns as it best suited her nefarious
schemes; she was actuated by no motive beyond
her personal ambition of holding the reins of power; she
cared not who or what was sacrificed, whether the life
and soul of her own child, or whether the result was the
downfall of every religious belief, the blood of her subjects,
the ruin of her provinces, and the desolation of the
homes of her people.</p>

<p>Not even fanaticism can be offered as a poor excuse for
her crimes; her infamous deeds can be cloaked by no
paltry plea of religious fervor. Her crimes were instigated
by her own diabolical soul, a willing ally of the
Prince of Darkness; and were it not for the strong menial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
abilities she manifested, one would imagine her some
grotesque monster of an animal. But her crafty schemes
betokened keen intellectual powers, and made her seem
some malignant demon in human shape sent forth from
the lowest depths of the Inferno to lure men and women
to destruction.</p>

<p>Catherine de’ Medici was a daughter of Lorenzo de’
Medici, that ruler of Florence for whom Machiavelli wrote
the “Prince.” Having lost both her parents in early
childhood, Catherine was sent to a convent to be educated.
Her uncle, Pope Clement VII., arranged with
Francis I. of France a marriage between Catherine and
the Duke of Orleans, afterwards Henry II. of France.
This marriage was celebrated in 1533, when Catherine
was fourteen years of age.</p>

<p>During the reign of Francis, Catherine exercised no
influence in France. She was a thick-set, plain, unprepossessing
girl; and being so young, and a foreigner, and
a native of a state having no great weight in the world of
politics, she was thrown entirely into the shade by more
important and attractive personages, having not yet given
any proof of her after great but iniquitous ability.</p>

<p>The court life at the time of Francis I. was beginning
to assume some of the brilliancy and splendor for which
it became so famous in the reign of <i>le Grand Monarque</i>.
The fall of Florence and the expulsion of the French from
Italy brought many Italians into France. Among these
were men of letters, poets, musicians, sculptors, painters,
and architects. Italian was generally understood at court,
and became a frequent medium of conversation. Many
Italian words were thus introduced into French phrases,
and the French tongue became thereby materially changed
and softened in its pronunciation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>It was at this time that so many old feudal fortresses
were torn down to give place to the châteaux of the
Renaissance. The king lived familiarly with artists,
men of letters and celebrities, and patronized all who
had made a name in art or literature.</p>

<p>Fontainebleau, which was originally a hunting-seat of
Saint Louis IX., began to rise into a stately palace under
the direction of Sebastian Serlio and Rosso, a Florentine.
This Italian artist, Rosso, or Battista di Jacopo, was
named by King Francis, “chief and superintendent over
all the buildings, paintings, and other decorations of the
palace,” with a large salary, for Rosso lived like <i>en grand
seigneur</i>. As a painter his industry was great, and he
displayed much ability in his designs for the decoration
of the <i>Galerie de François I.</i>, which he constructed over
the lower court. During the reign of Louis Philippe some
of Rosso’s paintings were discovered under a coating of
whitewash, and were restored by that king’s order.</p>

<p>But the <i>chef-d’œuvre</i> of the Renaissance was the
<i>Château de Chambord</i>, which, though it was not half
completed at the time of the visit of the Emperor Charles
V., so greatly excited his wonder and admiration.</p>

<p>One of the marvels of this château was “its double
spiral staircase of two hundred and eighty-six steps, rising
in the centre of the edifice from its basement to its
highest point,—the lantern, crowned by an enormous
<i>fleur-de-lys</i>. It was a sort of puzzle. Eight persons
could walk abreast up or down it, the ascending and descending
parties never meeting, yet seeing each other.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 433px;">

<div class="caption">FRANCIS I.</div>

<div class="attrib2">From a painting by Titian in the Louvre.</div>
</div>

<p>The Emperor Charles was also amazed at this time by
the gorgeousness and extravagance in dress displayed by
the <i>bourgeoisie</i>. “At Poitiers he was received by near
five hundred gentlemen, richly attired, and two thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
of the citizens in robes of velvet and satin, bordered with
gold and silver lace. From Orleans a still more imposing
cavalcade rode out to meet him. The <i>bourgeoisie</i> of this
royal city had certain privileges which, like the citizens
of Paris, they shared with the nobility. Ninety-two of
these privileged merchants of the upper <i>bourgeoisie</i> accompanied
the governor and persons of distinction to greet
the emperor. All of them were mounted on excellent
chargers, and all wore coats or casaques of black velvet,
and doublets or vests of white satin fastened with gold
buttons. Their boots were of white morocco, slashed,
and their spurs either silver-gilt or gold. Their caps or
toques were also of velvet, elaborately ornamented with
gold embroider and precious stones.”</p>

<p>Orleans was then considered a large, handsome town.
Charles V. said it was the finest city he saw in France.
“Where, then,” he was asked, “does your majesty place
Paris?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Paris,” he replied, “is no city, but rather a little
world.”</p>

<p>As Francis I. was ruled by his favorite, the <i>Duchesse d’
Étampes</i>, his wife, Queen Eleanor, was simply a dazzling
ornament in his court, where she always appeared in the
splendor of the most gorgeous attire, solacing herself with
the only privilege left to her, of displaying her rightful
rank and prestige. “Near her, as if to seek the protection
which her position afforded, if not her influence,—for
of that she had none,—the quiet, subtle girl-wife of
the youthful Prince Henry was always to be found. Of
all that passed around her nothing escaped her vigilant,
restless eyes. She was inwardly taking notes to serve for
her guidance in the future,—resigned to live, and learn,
and bide her time, fully assured—for was it not written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
in the stars?—that, as time rolled on, her turn would
come to sway the destinies of the kingdom.</p>

<p>“No attentions did Catherine de’ Medici receive or look
for from her boy-husband. He was a fluttering captive
in the chains of first love, and the most brilliant beauty of
the court, the famed <i>Diana de Poitiers</i>, was the lady of
his heart, at the shrine of whose loveliness he bowed the
knee. Prince Henry was then seventeen, and the lady
had numbered thirty-seven summers. As to winters, they
glided o’er her smooth, fair brow, leaving no trace of their
passage, or any snowy signs of age on her luxuriant raven
hair. Her husband, the Comte de Dreux-Brezé, died in
1531, and she erected a magnificent monument to his
memory, and ever after wore the widow’s dress. Nature
had made her beautiful forever, and beautiful she remained,
unaided by art, we are told, until the end of her
threescore years and nine.</p>

<p>“At this early period of Henry’s attachment to her,
Diana derived from it no influence at court. The king
disliked his second son, whose sentimental worship of an
‘aged siren,’ as envious ladies were pleased to call her,
was a subject of jest among his companions, while Diana
professed for the royal youth a tender but motherly affection;
placid Catherine looking on unmoved.”</p>

<p>But this placid Catherine would not always sheathe her
sharp stiletto of Italian craftiness, and then its gleaming
point would pierce the quivering hearts of her victims
with merciless cruelty.</p>

<p>During the reign of her husband, Henry II., Catherine
lived a quiet, unobtrusive life, having little or no influence
over the king, who was completely under the fascinating
sway of the beautiful widow, Diana of Poitiers, who, possessing
keen insight and much quick wit, was in reality
the sovereign of France during the reign of Henry II.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Catherine de’ Medici manifested no outward signs of her
discomfiture in thus having her place and power usurped
by her husband’s fair favorite, but she was silently waiting
her turn, and carefully observing the various moves
in the political game then being played in Europe. She
affected not only tolerance, but even friendship towards
Diana; but the crafty Italian was meanwhile watching
with tiger-cunning the right moment to spring forth from
her hidden lair and seize upon her coveted prize, <i>the imperial
power of the throne;</i> <i>this</i> was her only ambition.
With wise insight she realized the hopelessness of endeavoring
to free her husband from the ensnaring power of
Diana, and so she artfully made his favorite her friend,
and seemingly acquiesced in the ascendency of her rival.</p>

<p>On the 31st of March, 1547, Francis I. died, and in the
following July, Henry II. was crowned, his elder brother
having died some time before. On this occasion Diana
and Catherine sat together under a “canopied tribune,”
beholding the handsome prince in his royal robes, as he
knelt before the archbishop and received from his hands
the imperial crown.</p>

<p>But another character connected with this court demands
attention. Jeanne d’Albret, the daughter of
Queen Margaret of Navarre, was brought up at the
Court of Francis I. and educated in the Romish faith.
But her mother had adopted the principles of the Reformation,
and Jeanne d’Albret afterwards became the most
ardent defender of the Protestants at a time when such
defence required the bravest heart and most unflinching
courage.</p>

<p>Soon after the coronation of Henry II. the marriage of
Jeanne d’Albret, heiress of the kingdom of Navarre, was
celebrated in the Château de Moulins. The bridegroom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
was Antoine de Bourbon, Duc de Vendôme and first
prince of the blood after the sons of Henry II. King
Henry and his brilliant court repaired to Moulins to celebrate
these nuptials. Upon this occasion Catherine de’
Medici was attired with gorgeous splendor. She was very
fond of dress, and with the richly-robed Italian ladies in
her suite presented a magnificent spectacle. Amidst all
the brilliant costumes, one lady was distinguished by her
widow’s garb. But Madame Diana well understood her
charms, and in her costly robe of white and black velvet,
with veil of silver tissue and <i>coiffe</i> of netted velvet, bordered
with pearls, she became at once <i>distingué</i> and enchanting;
and though Catherine de’ Medici might flash in
gorgeous colors and royal jewels, her ugly, heavy features
and ungraceful form only appeared more unattractive by
the side of her beautiful rival. King Henry, who always
wore black and white in compliment to Diana, was attired
on this occasion “in a <i>pourpoint</i>, or vest of black velvet,
slashed with white satin, with short skirts or basques,
and a cloak of the same material, embroidered in broad
stripes of gold. Trunk-hose of white silk, very large, and
rounded with horse-hair or wool, a band of gold braiding
attaching them to the long white silk stockings, and white
silk shoes with black rosettes. A black velvet toque, with
a white plume of two or three feathers placed on the right
side, and bordered with four rows of black and white
pearls. His cravat was of fine lace, and an <i>escarcelle</i> or
pocket was fastened on his right side by gold chains to an
embroidered waist-belt.”</p>

<p>“The princes and other persons of distinction were
similarly dressed, the bridegroom wearing blue and white
velvet and satin, many jewels in his plumed hat, many
rings on his fingers, a jewelled pouch at his side, and a
massive gold chain passing twice round his neck.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>But a lovely vision was presented by the bride of nineteen,
Jeanne d’Albret, as she stood at the altar of the
chapel of Moulins. “She was arrayed in white and silver
satin brocade, her hair flowing loosely over her shoulders,
but confined at the forehead by a circlet of pearls with
diamond clasp, as was usual at that time for brides of
high degree. Her long, heavy train, embroidered in silver
and seed-pearls, was borne by four young pages in costumes
of blue velvet and silver, white satin shoes with
blue rosettes, and blue velvet toques with small white
plumes. The great width of the deeply pendent sleeves
(another distinguishing mark of the <i>toilettes</i> of ladies of
rank, women of inferior station being permitted far less
latitude in this respect) heavily embroidered to match the
train, seemed from their weight almost to need the services
of two more pages to support them. A stomacher
of pearls and diamonds, a <i>cordelière</i> of the same, silver-embroidered
satin shoes, and veil of Italian silver tissue
falling very low on the back of the dress, completed this
artistic and becoming bridal costume.”</p>

<p>But a sketch of Catherine de’ Medici has little to do
with such fascinating scenes. With the death of her
husband, King Henry, began the terrible spectacles of
bloodshed and vice and cruelties which have made her
name a synonyme of revolting wickedness. Not that
Henry II. was not also cruel and guilty of many crimes,
for he even celebrated his first appearance in Paris after
his coronation by the public burning on the Place de
Grève of half a dozen heretics; and he had established a
special chamber in the Parliament called significantly the
“Chambre Ardente”; and he would sit at the window of
the Hôtel-de-la-Roche-Pot, which commanded a full view
of the place of execution in the Rue Saint-Antoine, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
watch the writhings of the burning heretics; but notwithstanding
these atrocious instances, the cruelties of Catherine
de’ Medici were on so much larger scale, and planned
with such diabolical butchery, that in contrast Henry II.
seems almost humane.</p>

<p>The reign of Francis I. had left France in a mournful
condition. The peace of Crespy had hurt the feelings
both of royalty and of the nation. It had left England
in possession of Calais and Boulogne, and confirmed the
ascendency of Charles V. in Germany, Italy, and Spain
on the French frontiers. But Charles V. met his match
as a general, in the brave defender of Metz, the valiant
Duke of Guise, who commanded Henry II.’s forces at that
memorable siege. This successful defence against the
besieging army of the Emperor Charles V. gave Guise
vast renown, and weakened materially the power of
Charles.</p>

<p>France had been for nearly six years free from actual
war with the emperor, when the German princes sought
the aid of Henry II. in an alliance against Charles V.,
who was threatening to become as despotic in Germany
as he was in Spain. The German princes had proposed
to give Henry II. possession of the three cities, Metz,
Toul, and Verdun, or at least allow him to conquer them,
as these cities were not Germanic in language. As a
further inducement to the French king to make an alliance
with them, they promised to aid him in endeavoring
to recover from Charles, Henry’s heritage of Milan. This
had been the constant ambition of Francis I., to obtain
possession of this ancestral heritage. Henry accordingly
entered into negotiations with the German Princes; and
to the declaration of war of Maurice of Saxony against
the Emperor Charles, was appended a manifesto from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
king of France. “Therein Henry announced himself the
‘Defender of the liberties of Germany, and protector of
her captive princes,’ further stating, ‘that broken-hearted
(<i>le cœur navré</i>) at the condition of Germany, he could
not refuse to aid her, but had determined to do so to
the utmost of his power and ability, even to personally
engaging in this war, undertaken for liberty, and not for
his personal benefit.’ This document, written in French,
was headed by the representation of a cap between two
poniards, and around it the inscription, ‘The emblem of
liberty.’ It is said to have been copied from some ancient
coins, and to have been appropriated as the symbol of
freedom by Cæsar’s assassins. Thus singularly was
brought to light by a king of the French Renaissance that
terrible <i>cap of liberty</i>, before which the ancient crown of
France was one day destined to fall.”</p>

<p>Henry II., thereupon leaving Catherine de’ Medici as
regent in France, much to her profound surprise at such
unusual attention from her indifferent husband,—who
took good care, however, to tie her hands by such restrictions
that she was regent only in name, while Diana held
the real power,—departed with his army, and with ease
took possession of the cities of Metz, Toul, and Verdun.</p>

<p>It was in endeavoring to reconquer Metz that Charles
V. met his disastrous repulse in the brave defence of the
Duke of Guise, who was then governor of Metz.</p>

<p>After the fatigues and horrors of war, the French court
turned again to balls and tournaments, and the building
of châteaux, and the patronage of art. It was at this
time that Bernard Palissy was much patronized by the
fair Diana, whom Henry had made <i>Duchesse de Valentinois</i>,
presenting her with the <i>Château de Chenonceaux</i>,
which seemed to be the only attention from the king which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
caused Catherine de’ Medici to vow vengeance, as she had
desired to possess the château herself.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding desolating wars, the French court of
Henry II. far outshone that of Francis I. in extravagance
of dress and living.</p>

<p>“Never had any queen of France, except, perhaps,
Queen Eleanor, and her court been arrayed in brocades
so costly, or bedecked with gems more precious than
Catherine de’ Medici and her ladies, though the crown
jewels were worn by Madame Diana. At least they were
transferred to her when the reign of <i>Madame d’Etampes</i>
ended. Diana wore pearls only, black and white, which
harmonized with her mourning dress. She may, however,
have sometimes condescended to wear the crown diamonds,
though they were not of great value.</p>

<p>“Never had the <i>chefs-d’œuvre</i> of Italian cookery been
served at any state banquets on gold and silver plate in
greater profusion or of more artistic workmanship, or the
table ornamented with such magnificent productions of
the glass manufactories of Venice. Carriages sufficiently
capacious, luxuriously furnished, and ornamented with
thousands of gilt nails, now took the place of the litter
for travelling,—the gentlemen, when not aged or gouty,
still preferring horses.”</p>

<p>Jeromio Lippomano, writing to the senate, says:—</p>

<p>“The novelties or changes in the fashion of dress succeed
each other from day to day, I might almost say from
hour to hour. The French spend without measure on
their wardrobes and their table. As the profession of the
French noble is that of arms, he wears a short coat. But
it would be difficult to send you a model, so often is it
varied in color and form. To-day the brim of his hat
will extend beyond his shoulders; to-morrow his hat or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
cap will scarce cover the top of his head. His mantle
sometimes reaches to his ankles; at others no lower than
his loins. His shoes are either in the Greek fashion, or
that of Savoy,—so wide and so high that they reach the
middle of the leg, or so short and so narrow that they
resemble tubes. If the form of the garments is frequently
changed, no less so is the ridiculous manner of
wearing them, as buttoning one sleeve and leaving the
other open. When on horseback, these young warriors
carry the sword in the hand, and gallop through the city
as if in pursuit of an enemy, after the manner of the
Polish cavaliers.”</p>

<p>“Twenty-five to thirty dresses of different form, and all
elaborately embroidered, with an ample stock of fine
laces, feathers, and jewels, scarcely sufficed to make a
decent appearance at this luxurious and extravagant
court. The ladies cared not to bestow their smiles on a
cavalier who proclaimed his poverty by the scantiness of
his wardrobe.” So great was the cost of living at the
court that the courtiers took turns of three months each in
the court service, and then retired to their châteaux, that
they might retrench in their expenses, and so save enough
money to again make a brilliant appearance when attendance
at court was imposed upon them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Charles V. had retired to a monastery and
abdicated in favor of his son, Philip II. of Spain. Philip
had married Mary Tudor of England. Mary Stuart of
Scotland, a niece of the powerful House of Guise, had
been married to Francis, the Dauphin of France. Philip
II. had continued his father’s hostility to France, and the
desperate battle of Saint Quentin had not only defeated
the French, but had placed Montmorency, King Henry’s
favorite “good gossip,” a prisoner in the hands of Philip.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>It was at this time that Catherine de’ Medici first displayed
her political tact and courage. Henry had gone
to Compiègne, to raise troops, when the news reached
Paris of the capture of Saint Quentin. A great panic ensued.
Many fled from the city in fear, thinking the enemy
were approaching.</p>

<p>Catherine de’ Medici went to the parliament in full
state, accompanied by the cardinals, princes, and princesses,
and made such a stirring appeal to the authorities,
showing them the urgent necessity for an immediate levy
of troops, that parliament granted her 100,000 crowns for
that purpose.</p>

<p>From that day the position of Catherine de’ Medici was
changed. King Henry returning and learning of her prudent
measures, for the first time showed her some attention,
and thenceforward she assumed her place in the
court. The Duke of Guise was now put at the head of an
army by Henry, and Calais was speedily captured, to the
surprise and chagrin of Queen Mary of England and her
husband Philip II. of Spain.</p>

<p>But Philip’s army was now required elsewhere. The
inquisition gave him much work in Spain. His wife
Mary had died, and Elizabeth had ascended the English
throne. As she would not listen to his suit, he turned his
eyes towards France, and as Henry II. also desired peace,
that his “good gossip” might be liberated, the peace of
Cateau-Cambrésis was concluded, and Philip II. of Spain
married for his third wife Elizabeth, the daughter of
Henry II. and Catherine de’ Medici, then in her thirteenth
year. At the marriage tournament, the queens of France,
Spain, and Scotland were seated in the royal pavilion.
In another, no less gorgeous, sat Diana, still fair and fascinating,
though surrounded by daughters and granddaughters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>King Henry still wore Diana’s colors in the mock combats.
The king then invited Montgomery to break a lance
with him; Montgomery endeavored to excuse himself, but
Henry insisted. It was a fatal encounter. The two combatants
coming violently together, broke their lances, and
that of Montgomery pierced King Henry’s eye. He was
taken wounded to his palace, but the wound was mortal.
In eleven days Henry II. was dead.</p>

<p>The young prince ascended the throne as Francis II.;
but in less than a year he died, and his brother Charles
was proclaimed king as Charles IX. Over Francis II.,
Catherine de’ Medici did not have much power, for he was
absorbed in his love for his beautiful young wife, Mary,
Queen of Scots. But with the ascension of Charles, then
ten years old, Catherine de’ Medici as regent held in her
hands the reins of government, and soon unmasked her
true character.</p>

<p>At the close of the sixteenth century all Europe was
agitated by the controversy between the Catholics and
Protestants. The writings of Luther and Calvin and
other reformers had aroused the Christian world. Scotland
and England had established the reformed faith, and
in France the Protestant Huguenots had become quite numerous.
Their leaders were the Prince of Condé, Admiral
Coligni, and the House of Navarre. They were opposed
by the crown and many of the French nobles, the foremost
being the powerful House of Guise.</p>

<p>At this time Jeanne d’Albret comes prominently to the
front. This Jeanne d’Albret, now queen of Navarre, married
to a husband pitiably weak and vacillating, utterly
incapable of comprehending her nobility of soul, was
forced to take into her own hands the reins of government.
Surrounded by enemies on every side, she made no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
mistakes in political measures, sustained her ancestral
rights, battled for the cause of Protestantism, and was
at this time its most powerful protector. Catherine de’
Medici worshipped no deity but ambition. Jeanne d’Albret
was ready to sacrifice her throne and her life in the
support of the glorious cause of the Reformation.</p>

<p>Catherine espoused the cause of the Catholics because
she deemed them the stronger party, but she treacherously
endeavored to win to her side the young Prince Henry,
the son of Jeanne d’Albret, who had been taken to Catherine’s
court by his father, who was a Catholic. After
the death of her husband, Antoine de Bourbon, Jeanne
succeeded in bringing her son back to Navarre, where his
mother watched his character carefully, endeavoring to
uproot the evil tendencies which had been planted by the
corruption at the court of Catherine de’ Medici.</p>

<p>The first of the religious wars during the reign of
Charles IX. began in 1562. During this campaign the
Duke of Guise, who was the chief leader in the Catholic
party, was waylaid and killed by a young Protestant noble,
who had been persecuted, and therefore believed he was
justified in assassinating the leader of the Catholics, who
was considered the most formidable foe of the reformed
religion.</p>

<p>“France was the arena of woe upon which the Catholics
and Protestants of Europe hurled themselves against
each other. Catherine, breathing vengeance, headed the
Catholic army. Jeanne, calm yet inflexible, was recognized
as the head of the Protestant leaders.”</p>

<p>There were frequent skirmishes and battles. Many
thousand Protestants had perished. The Catholics now
waxing stronger, prepared for a decisive engagement.
The two forces met upon the field of Jarnac, in 1568. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
this dreadful contest the Protestants were defeated, and
their brave leader, Prince of Condé, was slain.</p>

<p>But at this critical moment, the heroic courage of
Jeanne d’Albret was undaunted. Presenting herself before
the terror-stricken Huguenots, she personally encouraged
the panic-stricken soldiers. This masterly address
of a woman to the soldiers of the Reformation has something
truly Napoleonic in its clear ringing cadences, and
something vastly grander than Napoleon’s aim, for it was
inspired by a desire to uphold and advance God’s kingdom,
rather than an ambitious thirst for increased power.
Whatever we may think of upholding any cause by the
use of the sword, we must admire these soul-stirring
words of this great and dauntless woman.</p>

<p>“Soldiers, you weep! But does the memory of Condé
demand nothing more than tears? Will you be satisfied
with profitless regrets? No! Let us unite and summon
back our courage to defend a cause which can never
perish. Does despair overpower you? <i>Despair!</i> that
shameful failing of weak natures! Can it be known to
you, noble warriors and Christian men? When I, the
queen, hope still, is it for you to fear? Because Condé
is dead, is all therefore lost? Does our cause cease to be
just and holy? No! God, who placed arms in his hand
for our defence, and who has already rescued you from
perils innumerable, has raised us up brothers in arms
worthy to succeed him, and to fight for the cause of our
country and the truth!... To these brave warriors I add
my son; make proof of his valor. Soldiers, I offer you
everything in my power to bestow,—my dominions, my
treasures, my life, and that which is dearer to me than
all—my children! I make here solemn oath before you
all, and you know me too well to doubt my word; I swear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
to defend to my last sigh the holy cause which now unites
us, which is that of honor and of truth.”</p>

<p>Around this brave queen of Navarre the Protestants
rallied their forces anew. Her son, Prince Henry,
pledged himself to consecrate all his energies to the
defence of the Reformation. Jeanne d’Albret presented
a gold medal to each of the chiefs of the army, with her
own name, together with that of her son, upon one side,
while on the other were inscribed the words, “Certain
peace, complete victory, or honorable death.” The heroic
queen became almost an object of adoration in the enthusiastic
hearts of her soldiers.</p>

<p>Catherine de’ Medici, noting the effect of the presence
of the queen of Navarre upon the Protestant troops, also
visited her army; and though she lavished presents and
harangued the soldiers, none admired and all secretly
despised her, even though they courted her through fear.</p>

<p>Again the opposing forces met upon the field of battle.
The Protestants were defeated with awful carnage. Coligni,
who led the soldiers of the Reformation, was severely
wounded, and carried off the field as dying, having received
a bullet wound in the jaw. The Catholics were jubilant,
but much to their surprise, in a few weeks Coligni, whom
they supposed to be dead, headed another force against
them. The brave queen of Navarre had rallied a third
army, and this time the tide turned in favor of the reformers.
Prince Henry of Navarre himself took part in this
battle, which was so greatly to the advantage of the Protestants
that Catherine offered them peace, which was
gladly accepted. This perfidious peace on Catherine’s
side “was but the first act in the awful tragedy of St.
Bartholomew.”</p>

<p>And now Catherine de’ Medici entered upon the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
act of this bloody drama. Death and a marriage were to
be her weapons in this scene. With flattering caresses
she lavished attentions upon the young prince of Navarre,
inviting him to her court, where she and her son Charles,
whom by this time she had so corrupted in mind and
morals that he was a submissive dupe in her Mephistophelian
plans, concocted their criminal schemes to entrap
him. About this time Charles was married to Elizabeth,
daughter of the Emperor Maximilian II. of Austria; and
Catherine improved the opportunity of the nuptial festivities
to lure Prince Henry and Jeanne d’Albret into her
power. Having secured this marriage for Charles, Catherine
now declared that Henry must be her son, and
offered him the hand of her daughter Marguerite. This
princess was beautiful, but was as devoid of principle as
her unrighteous mother.</p>

<p>Jeanne d’Albret was much opposed to this match, but
state considerations prevailed at last to gain her consent.
It was urged upon her that this marriage would protect
the Protestants from persecution, and save France from
further bloodshed. Thus did the malevolent but cunning
Catherine lure Jeanne to her doom, and entangle Henry
in the strong net of her evil designs, which should so long
imprison him.</p>

<p>Even the Admiral Coligni was deceived by the friendly
protestations of Catherine de’ Medici, and her son, Charles
IX., who by this time had become almost evil enough in
nature to suit the satanic desires of his atrocious mother.</p>

<p>Though Catherine and Charles IX. were plotting the
entire destruction of the Protestants, using this marriage
but as a cloak to cover their sinister plans, Charles IX.
with consummate perjury declared:—</p>

<p>“I give my sister in marriage, not only to the prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
of Navarre, but, as it were, to the whole Protestant party.
This will be the strongest and closest bond for the maintenance
of peace between my subjects, and a sure evidence
of my good-will towards the Protestants.”</p>

<p>At this very time he and his mother had planned to
lure the leaders of the Protestants to Paris as their guests
for the celebration of the wedding festivities; when at the
dire signal they were to be butchered in cold blood. After
receiving the queen of Navarre with every manifestation
of love, when the French king quite overacted his part,
calling Jeanne d’Albret, “his great aunt, his all, his best
beloved,” the following dialogue is said to have occurred
between Catherine and Charles, after the queen of Navarre
had retired.</p>

<p>“Well, mother,” said Charles laughing, “what do you
think of it? Do I play my little part well?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Catherine, “well; but it is of no use
unless it continues.”</p>

<p>“Allow me to go on,” said this debased king, “and
you will see that I shall ensnare them.”</p>

<p>And ensnare them they did truly. Hardly had the
queen of Navarre entered the sumptuous apartments
provided for her in the court of Catherine, ere she was
seized with a violent fever which continued nine days,
when she died.</p>

<p>Henry, her son, had not yet arrived in Paris, but was
travelling there more slowly with his retinue. Catherine
exhibited the most ostentatious demonstrations of grief.
Charles IX. uttered the loudest lamentations, and displayed
the most poignant sorrow. Notwithstanding these
efforts to allay suspicions, the report spread through
France and Europe that the queen of Navarre had been
perfidiously poisoned by Catherine de’ Medici. The Protestant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
writers assert that Jeanne d’Albret fell a victim to
poison, communicated by a pair of perfumed gloves. The
Catholics as firmly declare that she died from natural
causes. The truth cannot be ascertained.</p>

<p>But after events make the supposition very strong that
Jeanne d’Albret was the first victim in the massacre of
St. Bartholomew. Her death necessarily delayed the
marriage for a short time, but at length the nuptial day
arrived. The Admiral Coligni was with other prominent
Protestants lured to Paris. When friends urged him to
remain at home and not trust the protestations of the
perfidious queen, Coligni, who was much attached to
Henry, now the king of Navarre, replied:—</p>

<p>“I confide in the sacred word of his majesty.”</p>

<p>But poor Henry was as great a dupe as any, and he
was completely deceived by the cunning wiles of this
diabolical mother and son.</p>

<p>Protestants and Catholics of the highest rank, from all
parts of Europe, gathered in Paris to celebrate this
marriage, which was looked upon as a great stroke of
policy for the furtherance of peace between the conflicting
parties. But the haughty spirit of the Princess Margaret
had well-nigh defeated the nefarious schemes of her unprincipled
mother and brother. Piqued that Henry of
Navarre should show so little admiration for his betrothed,
whom he married only for state reasons, she vowed vengeance,
and took a peculiar time to display her unconquerable
pride. In the midst of the imposing nuptial ceremony,
when the officiating bishop asked her if she willingly
received Henry of Bourbon for her husband, she pouted
coquettishly, threw back her proud head in defiance, and
remained silent. Again the question was repeated; but
not all the powers of Europe could break her will. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
brother, Charles IX., knowing well his sister’s obstinacy,
relieved this embarrassing situation by coolly walking up
behind the haughty beauty, and placing his hand upon the
back of her head, compelled an involuntary nod. The
confused bishop quickly took the hint, and smilingly proceeded
with the ceremony. And thus this fatal marriage
was completed.</p>

<p>The Pope, not aware of the treachery which had been
planned, was aghast at such friendly relations between
the Catholics and the hated Protestants, and he sent a
legate to remonstrate with the French king. As the
moment had not arrived to reveal the hellish plot, Charles
replied: “I do wish that I could tell you all; but you
and the Pope shall soon know how beneficial this marriage
shall prove to the interests of religion. Take my word
for it, in a little time the holy father shall have to praise
my designs, my piety, and my zeal in behalf of the faith.”</p>

<p>Thus did Catherine de’ Medici and Charles dare to
mask their infernal schemes under the sacred name of
religion. But the end was not yet. Admiral Coligni
was the next victim. As he was passing through the
streets of Paris, a musket was discharged from the window
of a house, and two balls struck Coligni, one entering
his left arm and the other cutting off a finger of his right
hand. The assassin escaped. The wounded admiral
was conveyed to his apartments, and Henry of Navarre
and his Protestant friends gathered around the suffering
Coligni. Again Catherine and Charles declared their
utter abhorrence of the deed, and were even blasphemous
in their noisy protestations of sorrow.</p>

<p>Meanwhile this guilty pair thus consulted together.
Some circumstances seem to indicate that Charles was
not a party to the attempt on the life of the admiral;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
but Catherine is said to have thus moved him to enter
into her brutal plots:—</p>

<p>“Notwithstanding all your protestations, the deed will
certainly be laid to your charge. Civil war will be again
enkindled. The chiefs of the Protestants are now all in
Paris. You had better gain the victory at once here than
incur the hazard of a new campaign.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” replied Charles, petulantly, “since you
approve the murder of the admiral, I am content. But
let all the Huguenots also fall, that there may not be one
left to reproach me.”</p>

<p>While the young king of Navarre was by the bedside
of his wounded friend, the Admiral Coligni, recounting
to him the assurances of faith and honor given by Catherine
and Charles IX., these two were in secret council,
debating whether this Henry, the newly-made husband of
the daughter of one and the sister of the other, should
be included in the dreadful doom appointed for the Protestants.
It was at length decided that his life should be
spared, but that he should be kept in a kind of imprisonment,
and that he should be forced to abjure his Protestant
faith.</p>

<p>The young Duke of Guise was to take the lead of this
terrible carnage. As he believed that Coligni was a party
to the murder of his father, some years before, he determined
that he should be the first victim of this awful
night. He had issued secret orders for all the Catholics
“to wear a white cross on the hat, and to bind a piece of
white cloth around the arm,” that they might be thus
distinguished in the darkness of the night. The alarm-bell
in the tower of the Palace of Justice was to toll
the dire signal for the indiscriminate massacre of the
Protestants. The conspiracy extended throughout the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
provinces of France. Men, women, and children were
to be cut down without mercy.</p>

<p>“The storm was to burst at the same moment upon
the unsuspecting victims in every city and village of the
kingdom. Beacon-fires, with their lurid midnight glare,
were to flash the tidings from mountain to mountain.
The peal of alarm was to ring along from steeple to
steeple, from city to hamlet, from valley to hillside, till
the whole Catholic population should be aroused to obliterate
every vestige of Protestantism from the land.”</p>

<p>While Catherine and Charles were arranging every detail
of this monstrous crime, they lavished the warmest
and most flattering attention upon the Protestant generals
and nobles, whom they had lured within their insidious
power. The very day before that dreadful night Charles
entertained many of the most illustrious of the doomed
guests at a sumptuous feast in the Louvre, and detained
them in the palace all night by the most courteous and
pressing invitations to accept his hospitality.</p>

<p>Henry of Navarre had his suspicions aroused; but
though he was well aware of the utter depravity of
Catherine and Charles, he knew not where the blow
would fall. The young bride of Henry had not been
informed of this vile plot, and when about to retire to
her apartments in the palace, her sister Claude, who knew
of the coming danger, tried to detain her lest she might
suffer harm. Catherine sternly rebuked her daughter, and
bade her be silent. But Claude still held Margaret by
the arm, and said to Catherine, “It is a shame to send
her to be sacrificed, for if anything is discovered, they
(meaning the Catholics) will be sure to avenge themselves
upon her.” But the fiend-like Catherine, preferring
that her own child should risk danger and perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
death, rather than that her hellish work should be
thwarted, replied:—</p>

<p>“No harm will befall the queen of Navarre, and it is
my pleasure that she retire to her own apartments,
lest her absence should create suspicion.” Henry, Prince
of Joinville, who now held the title of the Duke of Guise,
was to be the chief leader of this infernal massacre.</p>

<p>He had ordered the tocsin, the signal for the massacre,
to be tolled at two o’clock in the morning. Meanwhile
Catherine and Charles watched in one of the apartments
of the Louvre for the fatal knell. Charles was wildly
excited. And at last, his mother fearing that his determination
to carry out this night’s hellish work was
wavering, she urged him to send a servant at once to
sound the alarm. Charles hesitated, and a cold sweat
covered his forehead. For with all his depravity he had
still remaining a slight spark of humanity; but the fiend
incarnate, his shameful mother, tauntingly exclaimed:
“Are you a coward?” Whereupon the tortured king
cried, “Well, then begin.”</p>

<p>And so upon the early morning air of a calm Sabbath,
Aug. 24, 1572, the direful tocsin pealed forth its death-doom;
and at this signal armed men rushed forth into
the streets shouting, “<i>Vive Dieu et le roi!</i>”</p>

<p>The awful carnage which followed is known in history
as the Massacre of St. Bartholomew, because it occurred
upon the anniversary of a festival in honor of St. Bartholomew,
which had long been celebrated.</p>

<p>As the solemn dirge from the steeple rang out upon
the air, the king stood at the window of the palace
trembling in every limb, but the demoniacal Catherine was
aroused to a frenzy of delight. The first victim was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
wounded Coligni. The Duke of Guise with three hundred
soldiers hastened to the lodgings of the admiral, and
the gates were forced and the assassins entered the sick
man’s chamber. Helpless, and abandoned by his frightened
servants, he was brutally butchered, and his bleeding
body was thrown out of the window at the command of
the Duke of Guise, who desired to look upon his dead
enemy. Giving the mangled corpse a kick in the face,
the duke exclaimed: “Courage, comrades, we have happily
begun. Let us now go for others. The king commands
it.”</p>

<p>Sixteen years from that time the Duke of Guise was
himself assassinated, and received a kick in the face from
Henry III., the brother of Charles IX., in whose service
he was performing these diabolical deeds.</p>

<p>The streets everywhere resounded with the cries of
“Kill! kill!”</p>

<p>At the commencement of the carnage, the queen of
Navarre was awakened by a cry at her door: “Navarre!
Navarre!” Supposing it was her husband, she ordered
her attendants to open the door, whereupon a bleeding
Huguenot rushed to her bedside and clasped the queen’s
arm, begging for his life. He was followed by Catholic
soldiers; but at the entreaty of the princess his life was
spared. Words are weak to describe the horrors of that
direful night. Gory bodies were suspended from the
windows; the dead were piled in heaps in the streets;
the pavements were slippery with the streaming blood;
human heads were kicked as footballs along the boulevards,
by the bestial fiends who had become frenzied with
the sight of blood. And in the midst of this awful scene
of terror, priests paraded in their sacerdotal robes, bearing
aloft the crucifixes, and shouting their blasphemous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
hymns of rejoicing, and inciting the demoniacal murderers
to fresh deeds of hellish hate. Catholic nobles and
generals rode through the streets with gorgeous retinues,
and called upon the people to wreak their vengeance upon
the helpless Protestants. For a whole week the massacre
continued, and it is estimated that one hundred thousand
Protestants perished throughout the kingdom.</p>

<p>When the morning was well advanced, Catherine,
Charles, and a profligate band of lords and ladies walked
through the reeking streets, and gazed with calmness and
satisfaction upon the heaps of dead piled up before the
Louvre; and they even indulged in ribald jest and merriment.</p>

<p>The Catholic pulpits resounded with exultant harangues
after this hellish work was ended, and in honor of the
event a medallion was struck off, with the inscription,
“<i>La Piété a reveillé la Justice</i>.”</p>

<p>From every part of Protestant Europe arose a cry of
horror. Queen Elizabeth shrouded her court in mourning,
and refused to give audience to the French ambassador,
who exclaimed in mortification and chagrin, “I am
ashamed to acknowledge myself a Frenchman.”</p>

<p>But Philip of Spain, the “Demon of the South,” wrote
to the infamous Catherine de’ Medici:—</p>

<p>“These tidings are the greatest and the most glorious
I could have received.”</p>

<p>Amid all the fiend-like deeds of men on earth, the
awful Massacre of St. Bartholomew stands without a
parallel.</p>

<p>The massacre of the priests of France during the dreadful
tragedy of the Revolution was human retaliation. In
the mysterious providence of God, the “iniquities of the
fathers are visited upon the children.” “The 24th of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
August, 1572, and the 2d of September, 1792, though
far apart in the records of time, are consecutive days in
the government of God.”</p>

<p>Upon the morning of St. Bartholomew’s day a band of
armed men entered the apartments of the king of Navarre,
and conveyed him to the presence of the king of France.
Frenzied with the scenes of blood he had already witnessed,
Charles with curses and blasphemous imprecations
commanded the king of Navarre, as he valued his life, to
abjure the Protestant faith. Charles gave him three days
to consider the question, and declared that at the end of
that time if he did not obey he should be strangled.
Henry yielded, and this blot upon his name was only
removed when, in 1598, as Henry IV. of France, he issued
his famous Edict of Nantes, which granted the Protestants
full liberty of conscience.</p>

<p>Two years after the Massacre of St. Bartholomew,
Charles IX. lay upon his death-bed. Not one hour of
peace had he known since that fatal event. His nights
had been filled with spectres of blood and murder, his
troubled sleep had been haunted with visions of horror.
His old nurse, though a Huguenot, had been saved by the
king’s order, and she now watched with him in these last
moments. One night, hearing the king moaning, weeping,
and sighing, she went gently up to his bed and drew
aside the curtains. “Ah, nurse, nurse,” cried the king,
“what bloodshed and what murders! Ah, what evil
counsel have I followed! O, my God! forgive me them,
and have mercy upon me! What shall I do? I am lost;
I see it well!” And with this hopeless wail of remorse,
Charles IX. expired.</p>

<p>But no emotions of regret or sorrow moved the stony
heart of Catherine de’ Medici. Having debased this son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
to her foul designs, she now spurned him in contempt for
his exhibitions of remorse. When her third and favorite
son, Henry, departed for Poland, of which kingdom he
had been elected king, she said to him: “Go, you will
not be long away.” For even before Charles was dead
she was looking forward with satisfaction to that probable
event, as a means of giving the throne of France to her
favorite child. But when, in 1574, Henry ascended the
French throne as Henry III., Catherine’s power was
already weakened, and she found that her son would not
be a pliant tool in her wicked hands. Not that he was
aught but worthless and vicious, but their evil plans no
longer harmonized. Their government for fifteen years
served only to make them lose their reputation for ability.
The tact of this utterly corrupted woman, and the weakness
of this irresolute prince, were feeble instruments in
taming the Catholics and Protestants who were now both
rising in rebellion around them.</p>

<p>The Catholics formed a League under the brave but
infamous Duke of Guise.</p>

<p>There were now three Henrys. Henry III., king of
France, Henry, king of Navarre, and Henry, duke of
Guise. The war which followed between those parties is
called the <i>War of the Three Henrys</i>.</p>

<p>We cannot give details, but during these contests,
which became religious wars, Henry of Guise was assassinated
and the corpse was kicked in the face by Henry III.,
who afterwards repaired to the sick-bed of Catherine de’
Medici, and exclaimed:—</p>

<p>“I have made myself this morning king of France
by putting to death the king of Paris,” which was the
title given to the Duke of Guise.</p>

<p>“Take care,” replied his heartless mother, “that you
do not soon find yourself <i>king of nothing!</i>”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>And king of nothing he soon was, though Catherine de’
Medici did not live to see his downfall. In twelve days
after she had thus heard, without the slightest emotion,
of the assassination of the duke who had been her most
zealous worker in the infamous Massacre of St. Bartholomew,
this iniquitous queen,—the personification of every
vice, who had lured all around her to destruction, who
had been always accompanied by bands of the most profligate
but beautiful women, known as her infamous <i>Flying
Squadron</i>, who by their fascinating wiles should secure
the victims her own cunning could not reach; this woman,—without
a single redeeming virtue, despised by the
Catholics, and hated by the Protestants, and execrated
by the world,—this fiendish spirit was at length the prey
of the grim conqueror, Death.</p>

<p>Seven months after the death of Catherine de’ Medici,
Henry III. was assassinated by a monk, and Henry of
Navarre was proclaimed king of France as Henry IV.
Thus had all Catherine de’ Medici’s vile scheming come to
naught. She and her sons died with the curses of the
nation on their heads, while the son of the illustrious and
faithful Huguenot, Jeanne d’Albret, sat upon the throne
of France.</p>

<h2>QUEEN ANNE.<br>

<small>A.D. 1664-1714.</small></h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“A partial world will listen to my lays,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">While Anna reigns, and sets a female name</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Unrivall’d in the glorious lists of fame.”—<span class="smcap">Young.</span></span></div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">SOME monarchs make their reign illustrious by their
own individual characters and famous deeds; other
sovereigns are illustrious only because their reigns have
been important epochs in the annals of history, irrespective
of any merits of their own or any renowned actions or
policies on their part. Upon the importance of certain
political and religious aspects of the times of the “Good
Queen Anne” rest all her claims to be enrolled upon the
lists of fame.</p>

<p>One kind and generous deed, however, must be credited
to her own good-natured heart. Without possessing
any of the refined tastes and mental capabilities of the
Stuart royal line, of which she was the last representative
upon the English throne, she nevertheless inherited the
generous disposition of her race, and she has made her
individual name to be held in loving remembrance by
her people, by the liberal fund which she relinquished
from her own entitled rights, in favor of the poor clergy,
whose petty livings, or rather “<i>starvings</i>,” had made the
lives of some of the most excellent and worthy in that
profession really objects of charitable commiseration.
The fund set apart for the relief of poor clergymen was
called “Queen Anne’s Bounty”; and surely this beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
charity, which placed her name high upon the list of
royal foundresses in the Christian church, must needs
cover many of her glaring defects of mind and character
beneath the shining mantle of unselfish benevolence.</p>

<p>Another claim which makes Queen Anne personally
illustrious is the fact that she was the first monarch
crowned as the sovereign of United Great Britain. Scotland
had been united with England under James I., but
only during the reign of Queen Anne was the union made
complete; and in October, 1707, the Parliament of Great
Britain sat for the first time.</p>

<p>“To have first thought of the Union was William III.’s
last title to glory; to Queen Anne’s counsellors, in particular
to Lord Somers, belongs the honor of having accomplished
the work and achieved the enterprise, in spite
of much violence and many obstacles. The representation
of Scotland in the United Parliament of Great Britain
was decided rather by its historical status as an independent
kingdom than by the proportion of its population;
forty-five representatives and sixteen Scottish peers were
to sit in Parliament.”</p>

<p>Thus Queen Anne is known in history as the first sovereign
of Great Britain.</p>

<p>Anne Stuart was the second daughter of James, Duke
of York, younger brother of Charles II. of England. Her
mother was Anne Hyde, the daughter of the illustrious
Lord Chancellor Clarendon. The Princess Anne was born
in 1664, and at the age of five years she was sent to
France on account of her delicate health, and while she
was in that country, in 1671, her mother died. In two
years after, her father, Duke James, was married to Maria
of Modena. This duchess was a kind and estimable
lady; but as she was a Roman Catholic and as Duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
James had also embraced that faith, Charles II. ordered
that the Princess Anne and her elder sister, the Princess
Mary, should be educated in the Protestant religion, as
his prospective successors after their father. Their father
never attempted to interfere with their Protestant education,
though they were allowed to reside in the same palace
with him.</p>

<p>In 1667 the Princess Mary was married to William,
Prince of Orange; and in 1679 her father was driven into
exile, and the Princess Anne and her step-mother were
permitted by Charles II. to reside with the exiled Duke
of York for some months in Brussels.</p>

<p>Previously to this time the friendship between the
Princess Anne and Sarah Jennings had been formed,
which in after-years exerted so important an influence
upon the destinies of both lives, and even became a remarkable
factor in determining the results of various portentious
political changes in Europe.</p>

<p>The elder sister of Sarah Jennings had been a maid of
honor to the first Duchess of York, the mother of Anne;
and when that princess was about nine years of age,
Sarah, who was then twelve years old, became the constant
companion of the young princess. Even in childhood
Sarah Jennings manifested many of the strong characteristics
of mind and will which gave her the overpowering
ascendency over the weak and good-natured Anne
which she maintained with such remarkable influence
after Anne became queen of England, and Sarah the
Duchess of Marlborough.</p>

<p>In 1678 Sarah Jennings married Colonel Churchill,
afterwards Duke of Marlborough, a gentleman attached
to the service of the Duke of York; and when Duke James
was sent into exile the Churchills accompanied his family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
and thus Anne was still permitted to enjoy the presence
of her favorite friend.</p>

<p>When James was recalled to England, his daughter
Anne and Sarah Churchill returned to their native
land; and upon the marriage of the Princess Anne
to Prince George of Denmark, in 1683, King Charles
of England settled upon his niece and her husband
the sum of £20,000 a year, and gave to her as
a residence the Cockpit, a capacious building which
had formerly been the theatre of Whitehall Palace.
Prince George Louis of Hanover, afterwards George I.
of England, had been a former suitor for the hand of the
Princess Anne, but on account of mutual aversion, when
the royal couple met for the first time, the match was
broken off, and the Prince of Denmark became the successful
suitor. The Prince of Denmark was poor and was
possessed of little influence, but he was a Protestant, and
that was esteemed a sufficient merit in his favor. He is
described as a “fair, good-natured, heavy-looking young
man, who spoke bad French, loved good wine, and was
rather awkward and bashful in his manners. He succeeded,
however, in pleasing the ‘gentle Lady Anne’; and as
they were both endued with good dispositions and equal
tempers, and neither of them very capable of discovering
each other’s deficiencies, this marriage proved extremely
happy, and they lived together in uninterrupted harmony”;
though, like most royal marriages, the princess
and her future husband were allowed a very short time to
make each other’s acquaintance; for the marriage took
place nine days after the Prince of Denmark had been
welcomed to London by the king and queen of England
and the parents of his future bride. The nuptial ceremony
was celebrated with great pomp, in the Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
Chapel at Saint James’s, by the Bishop of London, at ten
o’clock at night.</p>

<p>“The bride was given away by her merry uncle, Charles
II., who delighted in being present at marriages and christenings.
The chapel was brilliantly lighted; and as the
king, the queen, the Duke and Duchess of York, and
the leading nobility then in London were present, the
scene was magnificent, dazzling, and joyous. The citizens
of London also took their part in the nocturnal festivity.
Throughout the metropolis the bells rang all night, bonfires
blazed at every door, the conduits ran with wine, and
showers of fireworks and other popular sports and pastimes
were provided for the amusement of the people.”</p>

<p>“The Lady Anne, although not a peerless beauty, possessed
considerable personal attractions. She was of middle
size, but not so majestic as her sister Mary; and her
hair was a deep chestnut-brown; her complexion ruddy.
Her face was round, but rather comely than handsome;
her features were strong and regular; the only blemish in
her face was that of a defluxion, which had affected her
eyes when young, and left a contraction in her upper lids
and given a cloudiness to her countenance. Her bones
were small, her hands beautiful. She had an excellent ear
for music, was a good performer on the guitar; and her
voice being strong, clear, flexible, and melodious, she
took pleasure in the practice of vocal harmony.”</p>

<p>When Anne’s establishment was appointed by her uncle,
King Charles, after her marriage, Sarah Churchill was
permitted to become one of her ladies.</p>

<p>The death of Charles II. in 1685, which placed her
father upon the English throne, as James II., caused very
little immediate change in the household of the Princess
Anne. She became one of the central figures at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
father’s court, but possessed no particular influence, and
occupied herself with court gossip and card-playing, in the
society of her favorite, Lady Churchill, when not engaged
with the cares of her nursery. The Princess Anne was a
good wife and devoted mother; and although all her children
but one died in early infancy, it was not through
neglect on her part. But Anne was poorly fitted by
tastes or nature to play the brilliant part in history
which fortune afterwards decreed to her lot. She was
simply a good-natured, commonplace, and very weak-minded
woman, led by the stronger minds of her favorites,
and swayed by every political breeze around her.
Her favorites, to her credit be it said, however, were
women, and not men admirers. So that although her
character was undeniably weak and petty, her life as a
wife and mother was blameless, and her heart was kindly.
And yet such were the circumstances which environed
her after-years, that the name of this simple-minded
queen, whose narrow understanding might have been
compassed by the circumference of her thimble, and “who
put on her crown as she would have put on her cap”—the
name of this unaspiring, unqueenly woman, who
would have been more at home as a fish-wife than as a
sovereign, was pronounced with awe from one end of
Europe to the other; and even the <i>Grand Monarque</i> himself,
“hitherto the insolent arbiter of the world,” the
magnificent, the matchlessly imperial <i>Louis Quatorze</i>,
trembled on his throne before Queen Anne and her victorious
general, the Duke of Marlborough.</p>

<p>The French general, the Duke of Vendôme, who replaced
the defeated Marshal Villeroi, wrote concerning
Anne’s illustrious military leader:—</p>

<p>“Every one here is ready to take off his hat at the very
mention of Marlborough’s name.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>When, in after-years, the daring generalship of Marlborough
had been replaced by the daring ambition of
Bolingbroke, whose marvellous and impassioned eloquence
caused even Mr. Pitt in later years to exclaim, when
asked what treasures he would especially like to snatch
from out of the shadows of the past, “I would choose
one of the lost Decades of Livy and a speech of Bolingbroke’s!”—no
wonder that with such generals and such
orators, the name of Queen Anne was reflected to the
world in shining glory.</p>

<p>And what was the woman herself doing in the midst of
such stirring times and brilliant opportunities? Quarrelling
with the haughty, arrogant-willed Duchess of Marlborough;
bickering over some contested point of favoritism;
or becoming a puppet in the hands of an ignorant
bedchamber-woman, who ruled the queen because this
politic but petty Mrs. Masham knew enough to hold her
tongue when her royal mistress desired to rave against
her overbearing Duchess of Marlborough; and because
Mrs. Masham was smart enough to use her little stock of
brains in scheming to entrap the favor of the wily politicians
who courted her smiles because her ignorant but
keen cunning had gained the friendship of the queen.</p>

<p>Observing such a state of things, it is little wonder that
the quick-witted Addison flashed the scintillating sparks
of his keen humor all over the pages of his famous “Spectator
papers,” which appeared at that time.</p>

<p>Great Britain had been for some time divided into two
strong parties, known as the Whigs and Tories. The
Tories held that the rights of kings were divine, while
the Whigs contended a king ruled for the good of his subjects,
and that by illegal or oppressive acts he forfeited
his right to reign, and could be justifiably dethroned by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
his people. The Tories upheld the English Protestant
church, but detested the Presbyterians and Dissenters,
while they feared the Roman Catholics; while the Whigs
maintained that the Reformed religion being the religion
of the state, a Roman Catholic could not lawfully be
placed at its head. There was also a third party, called
the Jacobites, who were more violent Tories, being partisans
of the deposed James II., who, on account of his
Roman Catholic principles, which caused him to entertain
certain designs against the religion and liberty of the
state, had been obliged to fly from England upon the appearance
of his Protestant son-in-law, William, Prince of
Orange, who had invaded England at the head of an army,
and been placed by the English people upon the throne
in conjunction with his wife Mary, the eldest daughter of
James II., who had been educated a Protestant.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the benefit to the country arising from
the accession of the Protestant William and Mary to the
throne in place of the Catholic James II., the unfilial plottings
and intrigues of the princesses Mary and Anne,
abetted by their husbands, William, Prince of Orange,
and George, Duke of Denmark, against the indulgent
and kind-hearted James II., their father, was outrageous
and dastardly. Looking at the kingdom, it was well that
James II. was dethroned, and that his Catholic son, called
the “Pretender,” the half-brother of Mary and Anne,
was forever debarred from gaining his ancestral rights of
succession; but looking at the side of the treatment
which King James received at the hands of his daughters,
upon whom he had lavished every indulgent kindness,
the treacherous scheming, which in the course of events
resulted in vast benefits to England and to Europe, have
at the same time forever covered the names of the children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
of James II. with the stigma of most contemptible
and unfeeling and wicked ingratitude.</p>

<p>James II. having been deposed, William and Mary of
Orange ascended the throne of England, and William is
to be commended for several wise measures, and England
was much the gainer by her change of masters; but his
usurpation, which is called in history the “Revolution,”
is somewhat to be questioned upon the grounds of justice.
That it was highly beneficial no Protestant can for a
moment doubt; that the change of government caused
by the celebrated act of Parliament called the “Bill of
Rights,” which raised William and Mary to the throne,
to be succeeded by the Princess Anne, and in case Anne
died without heirs, that the right should then descend to
the Electress of Hanover, which succession afterwards
brought in the Protestant Georges of Hanover in place
of the Catholic House of Stuarts,—that a revolution
which caused this change of government was beneficial to
England and the world, is not to be underestimated.
This extraordinary but bloodless revolution occurred in
1688, just one hundred years before the bloody and terrible
French Revolution of 1789. But leaving political
questions and turning to the personal history of the Princess
Anne, we find her engaged in an ignoble squabble
with her sister, the Queen Mary, over the allowance which
shall be allotted to the maintenance of the household of
the Princess Anne. The princess had schemed with her
sister Mary and the Prince of Orange to dethrone their
father; and now that Mary is queen, Anne finds her
allowance given by her indulgent father cut off, and in
being treacherous to her father she has only worsted her
own condition. So disgraceful was this sisterly quarrel,
augmented by the haughty Lady Churchill (now the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Countess of Marlborough), who fomented the disputes
between the sisters, that at last the king and queen were
forced to make a compromise with Anne, and allow the
princess £50,000 a year. As Lord and Lady Marlborough
were known to be enthusiastic partisans of Anne,
they fell under the displeasure of King William and Queen
Mary, who demanded that Anne should banish them from
her household, and the Earl of Marlborough was deprived
of his offices. But this opposition only increased the
power of Lord and Lady Marlborough over the princess,
and she strenuously refused to part with her overbearing
favorite.</p>

<p>The lord chamberlain having been sent to Lady Marlborough
with the royal order to remove from Whitehall,
Anne immediately left Whitehall herself, declaring that
she “would live on bread and water, between four walls,
with her dear Mrs. Freeman, rather than that her friend
should ever be separated from her faithful Mrs. Morley.”
These assumed names of Freeman and Morley had been
chosen by the Princess Anne and Lady Marlborough that
they might converse and write to each other with greater
freedom from conventional restraints; and their respective
husbands were also called by them, the Lord Marlborough,
Mr. Freeman, and the Duke of Denmark, Mr.
Morley; and many were the political intrigues, as well as
friendly secrets, which they disclosed to each other under
these false names. These confidential letters became a
powerful weapon in the hands of the proud Lady Marlborough
in after-years, for when she found her influence
over Queen Anne was waning, and another was usurping
her place as royal favorite, the arrogant Lady Marlborough
threatened to publish these secret epistles, which
would reveal all of Anne’s treachery against her father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
and various other political intrigues. The fear of this
exposure made Anne a puppet in the hands of the self-willed
but brilliant duchess long after Anne’s intense
liking had turned to intense detestation.</p>

<p>The death of Queen Mary in 1694 somewhat changed
Anne’s position. When Anne heard of her sister’s dangerous
illness, she sent a request that she might be
allowed to come and see her; but their quarrels had never
been forgotten, and though Mary refused to see Anne,
she sent a message of forgiveness.</p>

<p>Anne now succeeded in becoming reconciled to King
William, and she received the greater part of her sister’s
jewels, in token of his friendliness.</p>

<p>Of many children Anne had only one son remaining.
He was a very bright and interesting boy of eleven years
of age. He had been treated with great kindness by
King William and Queen Mary, even throughout the disgraceful
family quarrels. But this beautiful boy, around
whom so many fond hopes clustered, died suddenly with
scarlet fever in 1700, having just celebrated his eleventh
birthday. The loss of this only child, the last of six,
was a terrible blow to the fond heart of the Princess
Anne. But she was soon called from private griefs to
public duties.</p>

<p>In 1702 King William died, and Anne was immediately
proclaimed queen.</p>

<p>“In the commencement of the reign of Anne, the Earl of
Marlborough was a Tory; but his wife became a Whig,
and, as a natural consequence, Marlborough was soon
drawn over to that party. Admiral Churchill, his brother,
was a violent Tory; Lord Sunderland, his son-in-law,
was a violent Whig; Lady Tyrconnel, the sister of Lady
Marlborough, was an enthusiastic Jacobite, and was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
this time one of the court of the exiled king. This one
instance will give some idea of the manner in which not
only the nation but private families were divided by the
spirit of faction.</p>

<p>“A continued series of disputes and intrigues agitated
the country; and among several minor events was the
trial of Dr. Sacheverel for preaching a seditious sermon,
a circumstance unimportant in itself, but which was made
to serve the purposes of a faction, and to inflame the
populace almost to frenzy. Never, perhaps, did party
spirit rage in a manner at once so disgraceful, so vicious,
and so ludicrous. It was not the strife of principles;
it was not, like the civil wars of the preceding century,
a grand struggle between liberty and despotism,—it
was a vile spirit of faction, which had filled the nation
with spleen and rancor, and extinguished the seeds of
good-nature, compassion, and humanity; which had affected
at once the morals and the common sense of the
people; and even interfered with the administration of
justice.</p>

<p>“The women, instead of tempering the animosities of
the time, blew up the flame of discord. Addison, in
some of the most elegant papers of the ‘Spectator,’
attempted to mitigate this evil spirit. He attacked the
men with grave humor and graver argument; he endeavored
to bring back the women to the decorum and reserve
of their sex by the most exquisite raillery, that delicate
mixture of satire and compliment in which he excelled;
he reminded these petticoat politicians and viragoes of
the tea-table that party spirit was in its nature a male
vice, made up of many angry passions, which were altogether
repugnant to the softness, modesty, and other
endearing qualities proper to their sex.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span></p>

<p>“He assured them there was nothing so injurious to a
pretty face as party zeal; that he had never known a
party woman who kept her beauty for a twelve-month;
and he conjured them, as they valued their complexions,
to abstain from all disputes of this nature. Every one
will recollect the admirable description of the Whig ladies
and the Tory ladies drawn up in battle array at the opera,
and <i>patched</i>, by way of distinction, on opposite sides of
the face; the perplexity of the Whig beauty, who had a
mole on the Tory side of her forehead, which exposed her
to the imputation of having gone over to the enemy; and
the despair of the Tory partisan, whom an unlucky pimple
had reduced to the necessity of applying a patch to the
wrong side of her face.</p>

<p>“But it was all in vain; a transient smile might have
been excited at such palpable absurdity; some partial
good was perhaps effected; but fashion and faction were
far too strong to be acted upon by wit, or argument, or
eloquence, or satire. At a time when a low-bred, artful,
ignorant bedchamber-woman, with no more sense than
would have sufficed to smooth a crumpled ribbon or comb
a lapdog, possessed supreme power, and Swift, Arbuthnot,
Harley, and Bolingbroke were dancing attendance in
her anteroom, it was in vain to preach to women the
forbearance and reserve proper to their sex, to point out
the confined sphere of their duties, or to remind them of
the advice of Pericles to the Athenian women, ‘not to
make themselves talked of one way or another.’ Mrs.
Masham ruled the queen, but she was herself the contemptible
tool of a set of designing men. In the end she
and her tutor Harley triumphed; the Tories prevailed; the
Whigs were all turned out; Marlborough was not only
disgraced at court, but, by a sudden turn of feeling produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
in the popular mind by the calumnies and contrivance
of his enemies, he became an object of contempt and
hatred; and he whose victories had been hailed with such
national pride and exultation, found himself ‘baited with
the rabble’s curse.’ This might have been contemned,
for mere popular clamor dies away, and leaves no trace
on the dispassionate page of history; but when Swift, the
political gladiator of that time, collected all his terrible
powers of invective and satire, and sarcasm, and fell
upon the devoted general, branding, stabbing, and slashing
at every stroke, he left the duke standing like a
column scathed by the thunderbolt, and the lapse of a
century has hardly enabled us to distinguish the truth
from falsehood of his rancorous libels.”</p>

<p>The brilliant victories of the Duke of Marlborough, in
alliance with the German princes under Prince Eugene,
had filled all Europe with wonder. In 1704, the victory
of Blenheim was achieved, and notwithstanding Marshal
Villars’ heroism at the battle of Malplaquet, in 1709, the
victory was gained by Marlborough and Prince Eugene,
though so great was the loss of the allies, that Villars
wrote to Louis XIV.: “If God permits us to lose such
another battle, your Majesty can count on your enemies
being destroyed.”</p>

<p>Marlborough had joined the Whigs because they were
in favor of war; but now the Tories were gaining the
ascendency in England; and with their coming into power
peace was declared, and the Marlboroughs were deposed
from their high places.</p>

<p>Wearied of the ill-temper of the haughty duchess,
which broke out in most violent language even in the
presence of the queen, Anne at last determined to rid
herself of her overbearing companion, whose strong will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
had for so long a time awed her into submission; while
the necessary military generalship of the illustrious duke
had long kept the queen from daring to dismiss the insolent
duchess, who at length forgot even her politic behavior
in her fits of anger, and endeavored to scold back the
favor of the queen which had been lost to her by her own
impolitic arrogance, and through the wily cunning of her
own relation, Mrs. Masham, whom she had herself recommended
to the queen for the position of bedchamber-woman,
never imagining that this poor ignorant relative
would usurp her own place as royal favorite.</p>

<p>Before Anne had ascended the throne, a little incident
occurred which eventually led to the downfall of the
duchess. The Princess Anne was one day alone in her
private drawing-room at St. James. The Duchess of
Marlborough entered the anteroom where the princess’
waiting-woman, afterwards Mrs. Masham, was in attendance.
Observing a pair of gloves upon the table, the
duchess, thinking they were her own, drew them upon her
hands. Whereupon the attendant remarked that the
gloves belonged to the princess, who had sent her to get
them, as her mistress was about to enter her carriage.
“What! have I touched anything that has been upon the
hands of that odious woman!” exclaimed the duchess in
a fury of ill-temper; and tearing them from her fingers
she threw them on the floor and retired, little thinking
that the insulting words had been overheard by the princess
in the adjoining room. From that moment the ultimate
disgrace of the imperious duchess was determined
upon, although, owing to her husband’s victories and her
own threats of publishing the confidential letters of her
“loving Mrs. Morley,” her downfall was long delayed.</p>

<p>Queen Anne had not ceased to be a loving wife, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
she became a sovereign; and the death of her husband in
1708 was a terrible blow to her. As the queen sat by
her dead, though she was the monarch of a vast realm,
she was the slave of court etiquette; and as the Duchess
of Marlborough still held her office as mistress of the
robes, this tyrannical etiquette required that the hated
duchess should invade even the sanctuary of Anne’s beloved
dead, and lead the queen from the funereal chamber.</p>

<p>But the days of the ascendency of the brilliant but
terrible virago were nearly numbered. In 1710, the Whig
ministry was deposed, and the Tories came into power.</p>

<p>“Anne could not cope with her discarded favorite in
eloquence and violence, but she could resist and dissemble;
above all, she could hold her tongue.” Influenced
by the Tories, who gained the ear of the queen through
the connivance of Mrs. Masham, it was secretly arranged
that the Whig ministry should be forced to retire; that
the Marlboroughs should be disgraced, and that peace
should be negotiated with Louis XIV. The proud duchess
had not yet been publicly informed of her impending downfall,
but rumors had reached her of the queen’s animosity.
Hastening to Kensington, she forced herself into the presence
of the queen, and demanded with the air of a sovereign
rather than a subject, of what she was accused.
The queen, aware that her only weapon against the sarcastic
and voluble tongue of the duchess was silence,
remarked with cutting composure: “I shall make no
answer to anything you say.” This was more than the
enraged duchess could bear, and she launched forth into
such a terrible tongue-lashing of violent vituperation,
that the incensed queen turned to leave the room; whereupon
the duchess exclaimed, “I am confident you will
suffer in this world or the next for so much inhumanity.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is my business,” retorted the queen, as she
lifted the portière and retired, leaving the discomfited
duchess to weep in a fury of rage and humiliation.</p>

<p>They never met again. When the Duke of Marlborough
returned from his campaign, not all his condescension in
begging on his knees that the golden key,—his wife’s
badge of office,—might be retained by her for a few weeks
sufficed to appease the queen. “I will have it in two
days,” exclaimed the angry Anne; and upon reporting
his failure to his indignant wife, she also hurled upon his
poor head her invectives of wrath, and throwing the
golden keys upon the floor, the haughty virago, who had
lost all power over her queen, but still maintained her
ascendency in her husband’s heart in spite of all her outbursts
of temper, sullenly retired, leaving her humiliated
spouse to pick up her tardily relinquished badge of office
and meekly bear it back in shame and sorrow to her
offended sovereign. Hard fate for a man to fall into the
snare of playing the go-between of two angry women,
especially when one is his wife and the other his sovereign.</p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess of Marlborough afterwards
went abroad, and their history is no longer connected with
that of Queen Anne.</p>

<p>The famous peace of Utrecht was signed in 1713.
The remainder of Queen Anne’s reign was unmomentous.
After her experience with the Duchess of Marlborough
she determined to assert her own will, but she deceived no
one but herself, as she was now alternately swayed by
her two favorites, the Duchess of Somerset, who was
appointed mistress of the robes, and Lady Masham, whom
she had raised to a title and made the keeper of the
privy purse. Swift says of Anne at this time:—<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>“Often, out of fear of being imposed upon by an
over-caution, she would impose upon herself; she took a
delight in refusing those who were thought to have the
greatest power with her, even in the most reasonable
things, and such as were necessary for her service; nor
would let them be done till she fell into the humor of it
herself.”</p>

<p>In her best days, Anne was merely a dull, uninformed
woman, without the slightest literary tastes, and yet her
reign is called the “Augustan Age of Anne,” and
the “wits of Queen Anne’s time” are held only second
to the “poets of the Elizabethan age.” No one would
probably have been more surprised than Anne herself
to have been thus classed with the glorious names
of literary fame, for she never read, and was hardly
cognizant of the existence of the brilliant minds which
gave her reign its brightest lustre. Sir Isaac Newton,
Pope, Dryden, Addison, Steele, Swift, De Foe, Gay,
Prior, Arbuthnot, Congreve, Young, Parnell, Granville,
and Bishop Atterbury, were the most celebrated among
the literary lights in her time.</p>

<p>The daily etiquette of the court life of Queen Anne is
thus described:—</p>

<p>“The bedchamber-woman came into waiting before
her majesty arose, and previous to prayers. If a lady of
the bedchamber were present, the bedchamber-woman
handed her the queen’s linen, and the lady put it on her
Majesty. Every time the queen changed her dress in the
course of the day her habiliments made the same formal
progress from hand to hand. When the queen washed
her hands, her page of the back stairs brought and set
upon a side-table a basin and ewer. Then the bed-chamber-woman
placed it before the queen, and knelt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
on the other side of the table over against the queen, the
lady of the bedchamber only looking on. The bedchamber-woman
poured the water out of the ewer on the
queen’s hands. It was also her duty to pull on the queen’s
gloves when her Majesty could not do it herself, which was
often the case, owing to her infirmity of gout. The page
of the back stairs was always called to put on the queen’s
shoes. When Queen Anne dined in public, her page
passed the glass to her bedchamber-woman, and she to
the lady in waiting; in due time it reached the lips of
royalty.”</p>

<p>There was little of the pomp and ceremony which distinguished
the court of the proud Elizabeth; indeed, Anne
herself was too careless and dull-witted, and the imperious
Duchess of Marlborough was too defiant of all restraints
to have insured that subservient obeisance which Elizabeth
demanded and received. Having been obliged, even in
her coronation procession, to be borne in a low arm-chair
on account of her gout, which prevented her walking in
regal majesty as all her predecessors had done, she continued
subject to this infirmity, which her gross eating
and drinking greatly increased. The stormy disputes
between her ministers, Oxford and Bolingbroke, became
so violent that at length the fear of having to submit to
a third terrible council with them, after two hot disputes
had been interrupted by her attacks of violent illness,
caused a burning fever, which threatened her life. Submitting
to the old remedy of bleeding, she was found to
be no better, and it was evident that her end was near.
Oxford having resigned his office of lord treasurer in a
rage, it became necessary to appoint some one in his place.
The Duke of Shrewsbury was suggested for the office, but
he would not accept the staff unless the queen herself laid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
it in his hand. Accordingly the white wand was placed
in the stiffening fingers of the dying queen, and the Duke
of Shrewsbury, approaching her bedside, asked:—</p>

<p>“Do you know to whom you give the white wand?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” murmured the still-conscious queen; “to the
Duke of Shrewsbury; and for God’s sake, use it for the
good of my people!”</p>

<p>Thus perished the last of the sovereigns of the House
of Stuart.</p>

<p>“The British sovereign is dead and the throne is
vacant,” were the few but expressive words sent to
George of Hanover; and without opposition, King
George I. ascended the throne of Great Britain.</p>

<h2>MARIA THERESA.<br>

<small>A.D. 1717-1780.</small></h2>

<div class="verse">“’Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">’Tis virtue that doth make them most admir’d;</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">’Tis government that makes them seem divine.”</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 18em;">—<span class="smcap">Shakespeare.</span></span></div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">ON the 13th of May, 1717, in the royal palace at
Vienna, a baby princess first opened her wondering
eyes upon this world, in whose history she was destined to
play an important, and what is still better, a highly commendable
part. This illustrious infant was christened by
the titles, Maria Theresa Valperga Amelia Christina.</p>

<p>Her father was Charles VI. of Austria, emperor of
Germany. Lady Wortley Montagu, who, as Mary Pierrepont,
had figured as one of the young ladies appointed to
bear the train of Queen Anne during her coronation ceremony,
afterwards visited the court of Vienna, shortly
before the birth of Maria Theresa, and describes the
mother of that princess, the lovely Elizabeth Christina of
Brunswick, as an empress of sweet and gracious manners
and amiable character.</p>

<p>But Maria Theresa far outshone both her parents in
beauty of person, strength of character, and marvellous
executive abilities, which have placed her in the very front
rank of female sovereigns; yea, still more, on account of
the rare combination of virtues and strength which her
character manifested, she stands at the very head of the
list of famous queens, equalled only perhaps by Isabella
of Castile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>In making this assertion, we refer only to Maria
Theresa’s individual claims to greatness; not to any importance
of the times, or concomitant circumstances,
which formed so large a part of Elizabeth’s acknowledged
powers; not upon great statesmen, great generals,
or great political or religious questions, depends the fame
of Maria Theresa. It was not the vast political importance
of her achievements, or the place which her kingdom
held in the rank of nations; but it was the mind and
nature of the sovereign herself, irrespective of any and
all surroundings, which makes her character luminous
with a stronger and more effulgent light than shines forth
from the name of any other female sovereign of the
world. In herself alone, in her own virtues; her strong
and well-balanced mind; her undaunted courage; her
unswerving allegiance to what is true, and pure, and
lovely in womankind, joined to an almost masculine
executive ability, which woman’s usually narrow horizon
often weakens, by sacrificing grand and comprehensive
policies to a pettiness of details; an executive ability as
statesman, and general, which made her no mean foe for
the vaunted greatness of Frederick the Second to combat,—these
traits, betokening a mind peerless among women,
a character peerless among sovereigns,—abilities ranking
her with the greatest of her times,—and best of all, virtues,
which placed her individually first upon the list of
female monarchs of the world; virtues which surround
her name with an undying halo of glory;—such are the
rightful claims of Maria Theresa to the most honored
place among the famous queens of history.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 486px;">
<img src="./girlsBooksFamousQueens_files/i-312.jpg" width="486" height="633" alt="wood cut of the queen">
<div class="caption">MARIA THERESA.</div>
</div>

<p>And yet we do not give this illustrious character as
much space as others in this book, because the events of
her reign were not as vital upon the history of Europe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
and the world as other epochs, and because the very
beauty and purity of her character demands no long
panegyric to prove her greatness; therefore her reign will
be summed up in a few words.</p>

<p>Catherine II. of Russia was probably equal to Maria
Theresa in executive ability; but Catherine is so revolting
as a woman, so devoid of every virtue of heart or
soul, that her fame is rather infamous notoriety than
commendable greatness. Elizabeth doubtless possessed
as strong a mind and keener cunning, and was undeniably
far more liberally educated; but Elizabeth was so
pitiably weak in her jealous vanity and heartless and
condemnatory gallantries, that she must rank beneath
Maria Theresa when they are individually compared.</p>

<p>Isabella of Castile stands nearer to Maria Theresa in
individual greatness than any of the other famous queens.
We have not included a sketch of her life in this volume,
because her history is so indissolubly intertwined with
that of Ferdinand V. of Spain; and in giving his life in
the companion book of “Famous Rulers,” we also there
outlined a brief sketch of Isabella of Castile.</p>

<p>Maria Theresa is the most illustrious example of an
“imperial woman of business.” She was big-brained
and energetic, having none of the mental weaknesses of
voluptuous natures. Lacking thereby, perhaps, somewhat
in warm emotions, but by her own inherent nature she
was exempted from falling into error. She was a model
of virtue both in public and private life.</p>

<p>“Maria Theresa was an embodiment of executive
regality. She had the promptitude, forethought, and
vigilance of a detective officer, and discharged duty with
the rigid precision of a policeman. She was essentially
practical, and thoroughly industrious-minded. She was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
ready in an emergency, equal to a difficulty, and sturdy
for order and regulation. She met reverses with boldness
and fortitude, and used prosperity for instituting
reforms. She was greatly remedial, remedying sudden
mischances by encountering them firmly, and remedying
existing evils with the strong hand of eradication.”</p>

<p>Frederick the Great, although politically her foe, said
of her: “Although I have made war against her, I have
never been her personal enemy. I have always respected
her; she was an honor to her sex, and the glory of her
throne.”</p>

<p>Maria Theresa was not only immaculately virtuous herself,
but she enforced the strictest rule of moral and
decorous demeanor both in her court and throughout her
dominions. Rigorous etiquette and staid decorum were
marked features of her imperial household and her own
conduct. Only once did she deign to notice one of profligate
notoriety when she desired to enter into friendly
alliance with France, she found the effeminate Louis XV.
unwilling to listen to the proposals of her ambassador.
Well knowing where the chief influence over the mind of
this weak king could be reached, she condescended to
write a letter to Madame de Pompadour, with the courteous
address “<i>Ma Chère Amie</i>.” This produced the
expected effect. Madame de Pompadour’s self-love and
vanity were so much flattered by such a mark of attention
from the imperial Maria Theresa, that, employing her
most seductive arts, she won the consent of Louis XV.
to enter into an alliance with Austria. But this political
policy must have cost the pure and exalted character of
Maria Theresa a sharp pang of personal mortification.</p>

<p>In 1736 Maria Theresa was married to Francis, Duke
of Lorraine. This marriage was one of love rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
policy, and the union was a happy one. Francis was
much inferior in mind to his beautiful and accomplished
wife, but Maria Theresa’s affection for him was sincere
and very constant through a long wedded life. The death
of her father, Charles VI., left Maria Theresa, in her
twenty-fourth year, Queen of Hungary and Bohemia,
Archduchess of Austria, Sovereign of the Netherlands,
and Duchess of Milan, of Parma, and of Placentia, in her
own right; and in right of her husband, she was also
Grand-Duchess of Tuscany. But notwithstanding these
numerous titles, her cause was in truth desperate. Her
father had endeavored to secure her undisputed succession
by means of the “Pragmatic Sanction,” which
declared Maria Theresa the heiress of the House of Austria.
This sanction had been ratified by several European
powers; but no sooner was Charles VI. dead than
claimants arose in all directions. “Within the first few
months of her reign, the Pragmatic Sanction, so frequently
guaranteed, was trampled under foot. France
deferred, and at length declined to acknowledge her title.
The Elector of Bavaria, supported by France, laid claim
to Austria, Hungary, and Bohemia. The king of Spain
also laid claim to the Austrian succession, and prepared
to seize on the Italian states; the king of Sardinia claimed
Milan; the king of Prussia, not satisfied with merely
advancing pretensions, pounced like a falcon on his prey,
and seized upon the whole duchy of Silesia, which he laid
waste and occupied with his armies.”</p>

<p>“The perils which surrounded Maria Theresa at her
accession were such as would have appalled the strongest
mind. She was not only encompassed by enemies without,
but threatened with commotions within: she was
without an army, without a treasury, and, in point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
fact, without a ministry; for those who composed the
<i>conference</i>, or state-council of Vienna, agreed but in one
thing,—in jealousy of the Duke of Lorraine.”</p>

<p>But Maria Theresa was never so great as in the midst
of apparently overwhelming adversity. Hungary clung
firmly to the young and dauntless queen, and to Hungary
she turned for aid. On the 13th of June, 1741, she was
crowned Queen of Hungary at Presburg. The coronation
was attended with all the national pomp and peculiar ceremonies
of that country. The iron crown of St. Stephen
was placed upon the head of the dazzlingly beautiful
Maria Theresa, then in the height of her fascinating
charms. Over her gem-encrusted royal robes was thrown
the sacred tattered mantle which was regarded by the
Hungarians as a revered insignia of the regal office.
Mounted on a superb charger, she then rode gallantly up
the Royal Mount, which was a rising hillock near Presburg
consecrated to this ceremony; and having reached
the summit, Maria Theresa, according to ancient custom,
drew forth her glistening sabre, and waved it around her
head, signalizing the idea of defiance to all the four quarters
of the world. The coronation ceremonies having
been completed, Maria Theresa returned to the great hall
of the palace, where a magnificent feast had been spread
for all the high dignitaries of the realm. The beautiful
queen sat in the place of honor; and as the day was
warm and the iron crown was heavy, she lifted the ancient
diadem from her brow, whereupon her luxuriant hair fell
upon her shoulders in picturesque abandon, making her
such a vision of beauty with her glowing cheeks, and
sparkling eyes, and regal bearing, that the old knights
and gallant lords could scarce refrain from shouting their
enthusiastic admiration for the lovely woman, and patriotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
reverence for their adored queen, in resounding acclamations.</p>

<p>Still greater was their enthusiasm when they were
assembled in the great hall of the castle, and the stately
queen, wearing the Hungarian mourning costume in memory
of her late father, entered the spacious apartment,
and ascended the platform from whence the kings of
Hungary had been accustomed to address their council
of lords.</p>

<p>Imperial indeed was the graceful Maria Theresa; majesty
sat enthroned upon her regal brow, and the sovereign
as well as the gracious woman beamed in her magnetic
eyes, while the melodious and alluring tones of her
pathetic voice seemed to commingle the inspiring resonance
of a bugle-call with the melting sweetness of the
rich chords swept from harp-strings, as she alternately
appealed to their patriotism, and her helpless condition
as queen, woman, and mother. Her stirring address to
them was made in Latin, and as she impressively committed
herself and children to their fidelity, lifting her
infant son Joseph in her arms and presenting him to the
assembled lords, a thousand warriors drew their sabres
from their scabbards and shouted with wild enthusiasm:
“<i>Moriamur pro rege nostro, Mariâ Theresâ</i>” (We will
die for our sovereign, Maria Theresa).</p>

<p>Overpowered by this enthusiastic devotion, the lustrous
eyes of the noble-spirited queen filled with grateful tears,
and as she pressed her handkerchief to her face a moment
to regain her composure, sobs were heard throughout the
assembly of Hungarian nobles, and every heart throbbed
with admiring devotion. Hungary was roused as one man,
and the dauntless and beautiful Maria Theresa was queen
of every heart as well as queen of swords and purses.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>Nor was the fame of her heroic courage limited to the
boundaries of Hungary. England did her honor. The
helpless situation of this young queen excited the liveliest
interest in her cause. The Parliament voted large subsidies
to support her; and the ladies of England, with the
old Duchess of Marlborough at their head, subscribed
£100,000 for her relief. But Maria Theresa graciously
declined this private gift, accepting only the aid of the
king and Parliament.</p>

<p>The enthusiasm in her behalf spread over all the states
of Austria, and semi-savage bands flocked to her standard
from all quarters. Vienna was strongly fortified, and
Germany and Prussia looked on in astonishment. This
helpless young queen, without money, armies, or powerful
ministers, they had supposed would be an easy prey.
But marvellous to relate, Austria, with only an inexperienced,
weak woman at its head, defies their vaunted
strength; and Frederick, the arrogant, fallen somewhat
“from his pitch of pride,” deigns to manifest some desire
for a conciliatory arrangement, providing that he can
keep his coveted Silesia. To this concession Maria Theresa
is forced to agree; for while she was defending herself
against Prussia, the French and Bavarians were overwhelming
her own Bohemia. The Elector of Bavaria
having seized Prague, he was elected Emperor of Germany,
and crowned at Frankfort by the title of Charles
VII. But within a few months the French were defeated.
Maria Theresa entered Prague, and was there crowned
queen of Bohemia in May, 1743. In Italy she was also
victorious. In 1744 she again lost Bavaria, but in the
following year Bohemia and Bavaria were recovered; and
Charles VII. dying soon after, Maria Theresa was enabled
to fulfil her proud ambition by placing the imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
crown of emperor upon her husband’s head. Francis was
proclaimed Emperor of Germany at Frankfort, and Maria
Theresa was the first to exclaim, “Long live the Emperor
Francis I.” Thus had been fulfilled one of her dearest
ambitions; and she had secured the restoration of the
imperial crown to her family, by whom it had been worn
for an uninterrupted period of above three hundred years.
Henceforth Maria Theresa, uniting in herself the titles of
Empress of Germany and Queen of Hungary and Bohemia,
is known in history as the “Empress-Queen.”</p>

<p>By the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, in 1748, Maria Theresa
retained possession of all her ancestral inheritance except
Silesia, Parma, Placentia, and Guastalla. “She recovered
the imperial dignity, which had been nearly wrested
from the House of Austria, and obtained the guarantee of
the Pragmatic Sanction from the principal powers of
Europe. Her father had left her without a single florin
in the treasury; and after eight years of war and the
loss of several states in 1750, her revenues exceeded
those of her predecessors by six millions.</p>

<p>“All the new laws and regulations, the changes and
improvements which took place, emanated from Maria
Theresa herself, and they were all more or less wisely and
benevolently planned, and beneficial in their effects.”</p>

<p>Her first war was purely one of self-defence, and the
sword was drawn in a just cause. Her enemy, Frederick
the Great, acknowledged that “the Austrian army
acquired, under the auspices of Maria Theresa, such a
degree of perfection as it had never attained under any
of her predecessors, and that a woman accomplished
designs worthy of a great man.”</p>

<p>Maria Theresa was a conscientious Catholic, but she
did not allow the Pope of Rome to dictate the affairs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
her kingdom, and she realized the necessary distinction
between temporal and spiritual jurisdictions.</p>

<p>“She suppressed the pensions charged at Rome upon
benefices; and forbade the alienation of property in favor
of ecclesiastical bodies.” She intrusted the spiritual
governments of convents to bishops, but placed their
secular matters in the hands of magistrates. She so
restrained the power of the Inquisition, then existing in
her Italian dominions, that the check she placed upon the
despotic operations of that diabolical institution, led to
its final abolishment in Lombardy and Tuscany at a later
period.</p>

<p>Maria Theresa was ever ready to make sacrifice of personal
ease for the good of her subjects. She was heard
to say:—</p>

<p>“I reproach myself with the time I spend in sleep as
so much robbed from my people.”</p>

<p>“No sooner did Maria Theresa find herself settled in
peaceful security, than she prepared to carry out her
systems of internal reform. The vestiges of war were
effaced; agriculture was revived; commerce and the arts
were encouraged; shipping interests were regarded; roads
constructed and repaired; Vienna was enlarged and embellished;
manufactories of woollen cloths, of porcelain,
of glass, and of silken stuffs, were established. Science
flourished in the foundation of several universities and
colleges; while one of them, still enjoying celebrity,
bears its sovereign’s name in gratitude to its foundress—‘Collegium
Theresianum.’</p>

<p>“Special schools of drawing, painting, and architecture
were instituted; while Prague and Innspruck had public
libraries endowed. Observatories, enriched with valuable
apparatus and instruments, arose in Vienna, in Gratz,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
and in Tirnau; Van Swieten was summoned to regenerate
the study of medicine and surgery, and Metastasio was
invited to help in disseminating a cultivation of the Italian
muse on the banks of the Danube. Measures of importance
and magnitude were effected by Maria Theresa in
the government of her people. She introduced great
amelioration into the feudal system as it then existed in Bohemia.
She abolished the torture in her hereditary states,—Hungary
and Bohemia. Severe penalties were attached
to literary piracy. She exerted herself to promote popular
education throughout her dominions, establishing a
general system, and taking means for its efficacious operation.
She divided into three classes the schools she
instituted; firstly, ‘normal schools,’ one in each province,
to serve as a model for all the other schools in the
province; secondly, ‘principal schools,’ in the large
towns; and thirdly, ‘commercial schools,’ in the smaller
towns and villages. The normal schools were superintended
by a director; those of the large towns were under
the superintendence of a magistrate; and the commercial
schools, under that of a parish priest, or an assessor of
the communal council.</p>

<p>“She granted extra emolument to those teachers whose
wives taught the girls sewing, knitting, and spinning; so
that children thus taught were able to earn a daily addition
to the family income. The system worked admirably,
and formed the basis of that extended popular education
which operates so beneficially throughout the Austrian
monarchy.”</p>

<p>Her second war with Frederick the Great, which lasted
seven years, was in the end productive of little besides a
terrible loss of life and money to both contestants. By
the treaty at its close not a foot of territory was gained or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
lost by either party. In this war Austria’s allies were
France and Russia. Maria Theresa was forty-eight years
of age at the end of this war. For twenty-four years all
Europe had watched her with wonder and admiration.
She had replaced the incapable Bartenstein by the able
minister, Prince Kaunitz, and for nearly thirty years he
ruled the councils of Austria as prime minister.</p>

<p>Maria Theresa was not satisfied short of knowing and
comprehending all things pertaining to her government.
She often devoted ten or twelve hours together to state
business; and notwithstanding this close attention to
governmental affairs, she still found time for society, and
the amusements of her court, as well as to be the mother
of sixteen children.</p>

<p>Maria Theresa was possessed of great beauty and a fine
presence. The dignity of her exalted rank was worn with
regal grace. “Her figure was tall, and formed with perfect
elegance; her deportment, imposing and majestic;
her features were regular; her eyes were gray, and full of
lustre and expression; she had the full Austrian lips, but
her mouth and smile were beautiful; her complexion was
transparent; she had a profusion of fine hair; and, to
complete her charms, the tone of her voice was peculiarly
soft and sweet. Her strict religious principles, or her
early and excessive love for her husband, or the pride of
her royal station, or perhaps all these combined, had preserved
her character from coquetry. She was not unconscious
of her powers of captivation, but she used them not
as a woman, but as a queen; not to win lovers, but to
gain over refractory subjects.”</p>

<p>It is recorded to her praise, “that she desired to be
informed of every act of the administration; that she
afforded the poor and humble, as well as the noble and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
rich, free access to her presence; that she listened
benignantly to all, either granting their petitions, or, if
she denied them, giving reasons for her refusal, without
delusive promises or vague evasions. During a forty
years’ reign she invariably showed a love of justice and
truth; and she stated, as a principle of her conduct, that
it is only the pleasure of alleviating distress and doing
good to the people that can render the weight of a crown
supportable to the wearer.”</p>

<p>In the year 1765, the Emperor Francis I. died. His
loss was sincerely mourned by Maria Theresa, who was
devotedly attached to her husband. She ever after wore
mourning for him, and frequently visited the imperial
mausoleum where he was entombed. In anticipation of
her own death she caused her coffin to be made, and
secretly sewed upon her own shroud. She was afterwards
buried in the grave-clothes thus made by her own hands.</p>

<p>Upon the death of the Emperor Francis, her eldest son
received the imperial crown as Joseph II. But Maria
Theresa continued to hold the first place in the government
until her death.</p>

<p>Maria Theresa gloried in her power of being able to be
a public benefactor; it pleased her to bestow benefits.
She richly deserved her title of “Mother of her people”;
and she declared just before her death that, “if anything
reprehensible had been done in her name, it was certainly
without her knowledge, as she had always desired the
welfare of her subjects.” Her annual private charities
and donations amounted to more than eighty thousand
a year; and so great was her benevolence that when her
son Joseph was accused of not being generous, he replied:
“If I gave like my mother, we should soon have nothing
left to give away.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>Her benefactions included all classes of her subjects.
She founded large hospitals for the infirm and wounded
soldiers, and opened asylums of comfort for the widows
of officers and young ladies of impoverished families.
With such a belligerent neighbor as Frederick the Great,
Maria Theresa could not feel assured of any continued
period of peace, and she therefore maintained a large
army of disciplined troops, and founded military academies
at Vienna, Neustadt, and Antwerp.</p>

<p>The simplicity of her court life was a great contrast to
the extravagant ostentation of Elizabeth and the dissolute
splendor of Catherine II. “In the morning an old man,
who could hardly be entitled a <i>chamberlain</i>, but merely
what is called on the continent a <i>frotteur</i>, entered her
sleeping-room about five or six o’clock, opened the shutters,
lighted the stove, and arranged the apartment. She
breakfasted on a cup of milk-coffee, then dressed and
heard mass. The floor of her room was so contrived that
it opened by a sliding <i>parquet</i>, and mass was celebrated
in the chapel beneath. On Tuesdays she received the
ministers of the various apartments; other days were set
apart for giving audience to foreigners and strangers, who,
according to the etiquette of the imperial court, were
always presented singly, and received in the private
apartments. There were stated days on which the poorest
and meanest of her subjects were admitted indiscriminately,
and they could speak to her in private if they so
desired. At other times, she attended to her letters,
memorials, despatches, signed papers, etc. During the
summer, which was spent mostly at her palaces of Schönbrunn,
or at Laxenburg, she would often walk in a shaded
avenue communicating with her apartments. A box was
buckled round her waist, filled with papers and memorials,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
which she carefully read as she promenaded, noting with
her pencil necessary answers or observations to each.”</p>

<p>She usually dined alone to economize time. After
dinner she attended to public business until six in the
evening, as she dined at noon; and until her hour of
retiring her daughters joined her, when she held a drawing-room
or engaged in games with her children. Her
daughters were all expected to present themselves at evening
prayers, which the empress held before retiring, and
nothing but sickness was allowed to interfere with this
family regulation.</p>

<p>About two years after the death of her husband she
was attacked by small-pox, which was very fatal in her
family, she having lost several children by this dread
disease. Upon her recovery her marvellous beauty was
greatly marred, and being thrown from her carriage soon
after and severely wounding her face, her scarred complexion
and altered features entirely destroyed her former
beauty of countenance, though her queenly bearing and
imperial grace continued to charm, and her voice lost
none of its melting sweetness.</p>

<p>Experiencing the dread effects of small-pox, she established
a small-pox hospital, and introduced inoculation in
her kingdom. She paid great attention to the purity of
her coinage, and so strong was the faith of her subjects in
the money coined under her supervision, that as late as
1830, the workmen at the mint at Milan were coining
dollars with the head of the empress-queen and the date
1780. “These dollars were intended for the Levant
trade; the people of the Greek Islands, being accustomed
to trust in the purity of the coinage bearing the effigy of
Maria Theresa, took it in exchange more readily than that
of any other potentate.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>The alliance of Maria Theresa with France was productive
of dire evils to her family in after-years, as the fate
of the beautiful Marie Antoinette, the youngest daughter
of Maria Theresa, fully exemplifies. Regarding her other
children, several of them were distinguished in after-life.
Besides her eldest son, the Emperor Joseph II., Leopold,
another son, was Grand-Duke of Tuscany for twenty-five
years, when he succeeded to the Empire in 1790. Ferdinand,
her third son, married the heiress of the House of
Modena, and became Duke of Modena. Maximilian became
Elector of Cologne. All of her daughters were
beautiful and accomplished. The archduchesses Marianna
and Elizabeth remained unmarried. The Archduchess
Christina, her mother’s favorite, married Prince
Albert of Saxony, which union, like that of her mother’s,
was for love rather than political expediency. Christina
exercised great influence over her younger sisters, Marie
Antoinette, queen of France, and Caroline, queen of
Naples. The Archduchess Amelia, another beautiful princess,
married the Duke of Parma. Two other sisters,
Joanna, and the lamented Josepha, died with small-pox
in their early womanhood. The death of the Archduchess
Josepha was particularly harrowing, as she contracted the
dread disease by obeying her mother’s wishes that she
should enter the family burial vault, previous to her
departure for Naples, as she was then betrothed to the
king of Naples, and go through with certain religious
ceremonies which Maria Theresa considered to be binding
upon a member of this illustrious family. The lovely
Josepha expressed great alarm regarding this exposure to
contagion, as her sister had lately died from small-pox;
but for once, Maria Theresa allowed her religious bigotry
to supplant her better reason, and the sad and tragic result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
of this filial obedience wrung the mother’s heart with anguish,
all the more bitter, as her own commands had
doubtless occasioned the death of her idolized child. A
third daughter, Caroline, was then betrothed to the King
of Naples, in place of her two sisters, whose successive
deaths had prevented the contemplated union with the
royal family of Naples, both of them having been affianced
one after the other, to King Ferdinand.</p>

<p>The great blot upon the otherwise illustrious name of
Maria Theresa was her participation in the iniquitous
partition of Poland. “She has been rescued from the
charge of having originated the unjust plan; since the document
of the secret convention, signed at St. Petersburg, on
the 17th of February, 1772, exists to prove the contrary;
wherein it is stated that if the court of Austria refuse consent
to the plan of partition, Prussia and Russia will combine
against her. Amid the general outcry that arose in
Europe against the crowned spoliators, Frederick the
Great slyly observed: ‘As to me, I fully expected all this
uproar of blame; but what will they say of her saintship,
my cousin?’”</p>

<p>Maria Theresa was now at the height of her grandeur
and power as a sovereign. She had largely extended her
territories. She had so increased her revenues that, notwithstanding
her immense expenses, she laid by each year
in her treasury two hundred thousand crowns. She maintained
an army of two hundred thousand men, and lived
in harmony with her ambitious and accomplished son, in
whose name the imperial power was vested. When war
with Prussia was again threatening her dominions, her skilful
negotiations with Frederick the Great, which resulted
in the peace of Teschen, covered her name with glory and
her life with honor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>“Maria Theresa often declared that no event of her
long reign had ever caused her such unmingled satisfaction
as the peace of Teschen.” It was a peace bought
without bloodshed. It was entirely her own work, originated
in her own benevolent heart. It was the means
of continuing to her kingdom the blessing of peaceful
prosperity, and it surrounded her dying head with a halo
of glory.</p>

<p>Death had long been insidiously approaching this illustrious
sovereign, but she felt no alarm, and prepared to
meet the end with calm resignation. Dropsy had at
length rendered her existence a continued torture, and
she welcomed the relief of death. Upon the last night
of her life she was engaged in signing papers and in giving
necessary directions to her successor. When her son
urged her to rest, she replied: “In a few hours I shall
appear before the judgment-seat of God, and would you
have me sleep?” Upon expressing her anxiety regarding
those who had long been aided by her private charities,
she said: “If I could wish for immortality on earth, it
would only be for the power of relieving the distressed.”</p>

<p>A short time before she breathed her last her attendants
thought that she slumbered, as she had closed her eyes;
and one whispered, “The empress sleeps.” She immediately
opened her eyes, saying with impressive calmness:
“No! I do not sleep; <i>I wish to meet my death awake!</i>”
Surely such a death-bed scene harmonized with the exalted
and illustrious life of Maria Theresa! She expired on
the 29th of November, 1780, in her sixty-fourth year.</p>

<p>Her biographers justly style her the “<i>most blameless
and beneficent sovereign who ever wore a crown</i>.”</p>

<p>The earthly dower of Maria Theresa was certainly the
richest ever granted to any female sovereign of the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
“A strong mind and feeling heart, royalty and beauty,
long life and prosperity, a happy marriage, a numerous
family, illustrious children, her people’s love, and the admiration
of the universe.”</p>

<h2>CATHERINE II.<br>

<small>A.D. 1729-1796.</small></h2>

<div class="center">

<small>“Here’s to the flaunting, extravagant queen.”—<span class="smcap">Sheridan.</span></small></div>


<p class="drop-cap">IN mighty Russia, that land of violent extremes, that
land of lavish wealth and utter poverty,—whose
frightful climate conquered the otherwise invincible Napoleon,
and with its keen frosts snapped the pillars of his
throne; where millions tremble before a despot whose will
is fettered by no constitution; whose prisons are the ice
realms of Siberia, whither so many trains of wretched
captives have passed to linger hopelessly in living tombs;
whose smouldering fires of discontent and hatred, fanned
by the ardent breath of Nihilism, are constantly breaking
out into rebellion and assassination,—in that land of
splendor and of barbarism, behold St. Petersburg, the
city of the Czars, founded by Peter the Great in 1703,
and risen out of the desolate marshes of Ladoga to be
the worthy capital of a great empire.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 472px;">

<div class="caption">CATHARINE II. OF RUSSIA.</div>
</div>

<p>St. Petersburg, the city of palaces, with its royal and
princely residences, adorned with Doric, Ionic and Corinthian
columns surmounted by massive friezes, entablatures,
and sculptures; with its Grecian and Gothic temples, its
great squares, its splendid, spacious streets, its monuments,
its warehouses and docks, its gardens and boulevards,
Cronstadt with its frowning bastions and painted
spires, and in the midst, giving to all an air of space, of
freedom, and dignity, the Neva, thronged by craft of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
kinds and sizes, from the tiny gondola to the man-of-war,
and from the mighty merchant ship to the rude
barge laden with timber or with grain,—presents a scene
of opulence and magnificence which makes it difficult to
realize that the foundations of this great metropolis were
placed in the quaking bogs of Lake Ladoga.</p>

<p>Upon the bank of the Neva, midway between the Senate
House and the Admiralty, stands that most famous of
the monuments of St. Petersburg,—the equestrian statue
of Peter the Great. A splendid statue, this, of bronze
and of colossal size. Peter, astride a mighty charger,
reins back his steed upon the brink of a precipice, and
stretches forth his sceptre, while he seems to survey with
proud triumph the wonderful growth of the city of which
he is the “creator,” and of which he might exclaim, as did
Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, “Is not this great Petersburg,
that I have built by the might of my power, and
for the honor of my majesty!”</p>

<p>Little did Peter think, when he laid aside the sceptre of
his empire, that five women would reign after him in
almost direct succession, and that the last, the greatest of
them all, would rear to him this costly monument upon
the borders of the Neva.</p>

<p>Peter I. was succeeded by his wife, Catherine, who governed
for two years, then Peter II., a poor boy of fourteen,
who had the privilege of ruling nominally for a few
months, and then Anne, niece of Peter I. was placed
upon the throne.</p>

<p>Anne reigned ten years, or rather her favorites reigned
for her, and in 1740 she ended her insignificant life.
Then baby Prince Ivan was proclaimed Emperor Ivan III.
But his mother, Anne of Mecklenburg, thirsted for imperial
power. So Biren, the regent, went to Siberia, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
Anne of Mecklenberg ruled in his stead. It was only for
a year, however, for in 1741 Elizabeth, cousin of Anne,
headed the imperial guards who had revolted, and declared
herself Empress Elizabeth the First.</p>

<p>Elizabeth ruled for twenty years, and commenced by
declaring that “she would never put a subject to death
upon any provocation whatever,”—a principle all very
fine in theory, but never put in practice. And since it so
affected her tender heart to take the lives of her dear
subjects, she contented herself by sending them to
Siberia, which answered her purpose quite as well.</p>

<p>“Joanna,” said she to her lady of the bedchamber, who
one day reproached her for the miserable manner in which
she educated her nephew, the grand-duke,—“Joanna,
<i>knowest thou the road to Siberia?</i>” Joanna took the hint
and henceforth held her peace.</p>

<p>On the 2d of May, 1729, at Stettin, in Prussia, was
born Sophia Augusta Frederica, Princess of Anhalt-Zerbst-Bernburg,
who, in 1762, resigned all these sonorous
and illustrious titles to be called simply—<i>Catherine II.</i></p>

<p>In 1747 the Empress Elizabeth married her nephew,
the worthless grand-duke, to this Princess of Anhalt,
and at the death of the empress, in 1761, he became
Peter III.</p>

<p>Things went smoothly enough for the first few months,
but soon Sophia Augusta Frederica, Princess of Anhalt,
desired to reign alone and undisputed upon the throne
of the Romanoffs, and in that highly moral and virtuous
assembly, the imperial court of St. Petersburg, there
were many who, in the hope of self-aggrandizement,
would not scruple to terminate the mortal career of the
Emperor Peter the Third.</p>

<p>There were three separate conspiracies against the life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
of Peter; and Catherine, who appeared to do nothing
herself, was in reality the mover of all.</p>

<p>Peter was spending a few days at his country palace of
Oranienbaum, from whence he was to proceed to the
palace of Peterhof, where the conspirators intended to
seize and carry him off.</p>

<p>But all these fine plans were overthrown by a soldier of
the guard, who innocently asked his captain on what day
they were to take up arms against the emperor. The
terrified captain, who knew nothing of the conspiracy,
gave notice to his superiors. Then all is terror in the
ranks of the conspirators; and the Princess Dashkoff,
when she learns of the discovery of the plot, hastily gives
intelligence to her party. The Empress Catherine sleeps
at Peterhof, where she has gone to meet her husband.
At two o’clock in the morning a soldier stands at her
bedside. It is Alexis Orloff. “Your Majesty,” he says,
“has not a moment to lose; rise and follow me!”</p>

<p>The empress and her maid dress in haste. Orloff conducts
them to the garden gate, where a carriage is in waiting.
The empress and her maid are placed in it. Alexis
seizes the reins, and they are off at a gallop.</p>

<p>Before they have gone far the carriage breaks, and
Catherine is compelled to continue her journey on foot.
When they have walked about a mile, they meet a peasant
driving a country cart. Immediately Alexis Orloff
seizes the horses, places the empress in the cart, and
drives at full speed toward the capital.</p>

<p>The Emperor Peter III. sleeps quietly in his palace at
Oranienbaum, while his wife, Catherine II., drives madly
along the road from Peterhof to Petersburg, to place
upon her head the imperial diadem of Russia.</p>

<p>At seven in the morning Catherine reached St. Petersburg.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
She immediately presented herself to the soldiers,
assuring them that the Czar, her husband, intended to put
her to death that very night, and that they were her only
protection. This lie was believed at the moment, and the
men swore to die in her defence.</p>

<p>The Orloffs raised a cry of “Long live the Empress
Catherine!” and the soldiers echoed the shout. Their
officers encouraged them, and when Villebois, general of
artillery, ventured to remonstrate, Catherine turned upon
him haughtily, told him she wanted no advice of his, but
to know what he intended to do. The general, confounded
at her assumed air of command, could only
stammer, “To obey your Majesty!” and immediately
delivered the arsenals and magazines of the city into her
hands.</p>

<p>Thus in two hours did Catherine find herself upon the
throne, with an army at her command, and the capital at
her feet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Peter III., totally unconscious of the usurpation
of his unfaithful spouse, ordered his carriage, and
set out for Peterhof, where he was informed of the revolt.
This news threw him into such horror and confusion, that
for a time he lost the use of his faculties. He could
resolve on nothing, and his imbecility was like that of a
terrified child.</p>

<p>Finally, however, he sat down and wrote a submissive
letter to Catherine, acknowledging his errors, and proposing
to share the sovereign authority with her. To this
letter Catherine gave no reply, except to send Count
Panin to the Czar, who persuaded him to sign a declaration
that he was not fit to reign, and that he voluntarily
abdicated the throne. Having done this, the poor, weak
prince was carried off and locked up in the palace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
Ropscha. “It was necessary that some apparent reason
should be given for such extraordinary proceedings, and
a short manifesto was accordingly set forth, proclaiming
the accession of Catherine, without any mention of the
unhappy emperor, but alleging as her only motives for
assuming the government her tender regard for the welfare
of the people, and above all for the holy and orthodox
Greek religion, which she feared was exposed to total
ruin; and this notable document of state villany thus
concludes: ‘For these causes, etc., we, putting our trust
in Almighty God and in his divine justice, have ascended
the imperial throne of all the Russias, and have received
a solemn oath of fidelity from all our faithful subjects.’
Dated June 28, 1762.</p>

<p>“Thus, by a revolution which never could have occurred
under any other government than that of Russia, which
few could account for and no one seemed to comprehend,—which
was accomplished in the course of a single day,
without injury to individuals, and without tumultuous violence,—did
a young woman, a foreigner, and a stranger
to the imperial blood, spring into the throne of the Czars.”</p>

<p>Catherine II., having thus established herself upon the
throne, began to consider how she could best retain her
newly acquired power. The first obstacle which presented
itself to her mind was the Czar, Peter III. She had him
under lock and key at Ropscha, it is true, but then he had
his friends and his faithful Holstein guards, who had seen
his downfall with grief and indignation. So Peter III.
must be made an end of, and those most accomplished of
villains, Orloff and Baratinsky, were sent to Ropscha
to make an end of him, which deed they performed very
satisfactorily both to themselves and to the empress, by
strangling him in his dining apartment with a napkin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>The news of his death was announced to the empress
as she was on the point of holding her court, but, as the
proper precautions had not been taken, she did not choose
to make it public, and went on with her audience with
every appearance of cheerfulness and tranquillity. On the
following day, while dining in public, the death of the
Czar was formally announced; and immediately she rose
from the table, all bathed in tears, and retired to her
apartment, where for several days she feigned the greatest
grief. She afterward published a manifesto, in which
she announced to her subjects “that it had pleased Almighty
God to remove the late Emperor Peter the Third
from this world, by a violent attack of a malady to which
he had heretofore been subject, and desiring them to
consider it as an especial act of Providence working in
her favor.” None were stupid enough to believe this monstrous
lie, and none were bold enough to contradict it, and
this was answer sufficient for the Empress Catherine II.</p>

<p>But “what a sight for the nation itself, a calm spectator
of these events! On one side, the grandson of
Peter I. dethroned and put to death; on the other, the
grandson of the Czar Ivan languishing in fetters; while a
Princess of Anhalt usurps the throne of their ancestors,
clearing her way to it by a regicide.”</p>

<p>As a sovereign, Catherine displayed marked ability.
She effected several useful reforms, established important
institutions, encouraged national intercourse, founded
schools and hospitals, and erected arsenals and manufactories.</p>

<p>During her lifetime she published a list of two hundred
and forty-five cities which she had founded in her dominions.
This sounds very grand; but we may look as vainly
for her cities as for those of Babylonian Semiramis. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
some instances she merely indicated the spot where she
intended a city should be erected; in others, she gave
the name of a city to some hamlet or village.</p>

<p>When she made her famous voyage down the Dnieper,
in 1787, Joseph II. accompanied her to lay the foundations
of a city to be called, after her name, <i>Ekaterinaslof</i>,
and which, in her imagination, already rivalled St. Petersburg.
The empress laid the first stone with great pomp,
and the emperor laid the second. On returning from the
ceremony, Joseph remarked, in his dry, epigrammatic
manner: “The empress and I have this day achieved a
great work; she has laid the <i>first</i> stone of a great city,
and I have laid the <i>last</i>.” His speech was prophetic.
The city never proceeded farther, nor was it thought of
again.</p>

<p>Catherine had one overmastering passion,—ambition;
and since the basis of her character was selfishness, her
ambition began and ended with herself. She was shrewd
in principle, astute in judgment, hard in character, and
hopelessly corrupt in morals. But “she knew how to
make herself looked up to, if not with respect and liking,
at least with deference; and Frederick the Great, Louis
XV., Maria Theresa, and George III., each in their turn,
learned to regard her acts with attention.”</p>

<p>The principal fame of Catherine rests on her celebrated
code of laws, and on her title of <i>legislatrix</i> of her dominions.</p>

<p>“If,” said Frederick of Prussia, “several women as
sovereigns have obtained a deserved celebrity,—Semiramis
for her conquests, Elizabeth of England for her
political sagacity, Maria Theresa for her astonishing firmness
of character,—to Catherine alone may be given the
title of a female law-giver.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>But how much of this was fulsome flattery and how
much honest praise, it is not very difficult to discern,
considering the gross nature of Catherine, and the cunning
diplomacy of Frederick.</p>

<p>Catherine is said to have doubled the resources and
revenues of her empire. Undoubtedly she increased the
resources by the extension of her commerce; and by her
conquests over the Turks, which threw open the trade
and navigation of the Mediterranean, she added greatly
to the power of Russia; but she exhausted her resources
much faster than she could create them, and she wasted
her revenues more quickly than she could replenish them.
She doubled and trebled the taxes of her oppressed people,
and the legal pillage of her tyrannical officers drove
whole provinces to desperation.</p>

<p>“Kings and queens,” she wrote in her letter to Queen
Marie Antoinette, “ought to proceed in their career undisturbed
by the cries of the people, as the moon pursues
her course unimpeded by the howling of the dogs.” A
fine sentiment truly, and one which she took good care
should not grow dull for want of use during her lifetime.</p>

<p>To find some parallel for the criminal profusion of
Catherine, a profusion which exceeds all calculation, we
must go back to the days of Caligula and Heliogabalus.</p>

<p>Her favorites were countless: her lavishness towards
them almost incredible. Upon them she squandered a
sum equal to $100,000,000.</p>

<p>She bestowed estates equal in extent to provinces; and
by a word, by a stroke of her pen, she, who called her
people her children, and, by her royal clemency, had substituted
the word <i>subject</i> for <i>slave</i>, gave away thousands,
tens of thousands, of serfs, poor wretches transferred like
cattle from one proprietor to another. “She gave diamonds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
by handfuls, and made gold and silver as common
as pebbles. Yet when we read over the names and qualifications
of those who were her confidants and ministers,
or of those who were particularly distinguished by her
munificence, it is like looking over the peerage of Pandemonium”;
for where but in the court of Russia, with a
female Louis XV. in the person of Catherine II. upon
the imperial throne, could such an assemblage of fiends
and savages, ruffians and reptiles, demons and cormorants,
have been congregated together to fatten on the blood and
tears of an oppressed people?</p>

<p>In pursuance of the mighty plans which she had formed,
Catherine kept two objects steadily in view: first, to extend
her dominions on the west by seizing Poland; and
secondly, to drive the Turks from Constantinople.</p>

<p>She began with Poland, marched an army into that
country, forced upon the Poles a king of her own choice,
dictated laws at the point of the bayonet, intimidated
the weak by threats, and massacred and exiled all who
resisted.</p>

<p>The Poles could not endure this usurpation of their
country. They rose against the Russians, and from 1765,
when Catherine first invaded the country, till its final seizure
in 1795, Poland presented a scene of horror, calamity,
and crime.</p>

<p>The Poles besought the aid of the Turks, and thus
began the first Turkish war declared in 1768. Fierce and
bloody was this war, and in 1774 the Turks were compelled
to sue for peace, acceding to the humiliating conditions
which Catherine haughtily demanded, that the
Ottoman Porte should recognize the independence of the
Crimea, and yield to Russia the free navigation of the
Black Sea and the Archipelago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1774 also, the empress-queen disgraced Gregory
Orloff and raised to the post of favorite and chief minister,
Potemkin, afterward Prince Potemkin, of infamous renown,
who for more than twenty years held the highest honors
of the empire. He was neither a great statesman nor a
great general, but he was certainly an extraordinary man.
He had all the petulance, audacity, and wilfulness of a
spoiled boy, yet he possessed a genius fit to conceive and
execute great designs. “His character displayed a singular
union of barbarism and grandeur, and of the most
inconsistent and apparently incompatible qualities. He
was at once the most indolent and the most active man in
the world; the most luxurious, and the most indefatigable;
no dangers appalled and no difficulties repulsed him; yet
the slightest caprice, a mere fit of temper, would cause
him to abandon projects of vital importance. At one
time he talked of making himself king of Poland; at
another of turning monk or bishop. He began everything,
completed nothing, disordered the finances, disorganized
the army, depopulated the country. He lived
with the magnificence of a sovereign prince. At one
moment he would make an aide-de-camp ride two or three
hundred miles to bring him a melon or a pineapple; at
another he would be found devouring a raw carrot or
cucumber in his own antechamber.</p>

<p>“He scarcely ever opened a book, yet he learned everything,
and forgot nothing; his wonderful quickness in
appropriating the knowledge of others served him instead
of study. Altogether his great qualities and his defects
precisely fitted him to obtain the ascendency over such a
mind as that of Catherine; she grew tired of others, but
his caprices, his magnificence, and his gigantic plans, continually
interested and occupied her.” Under his administration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
all things did not go on well, we may be sure
but all <i>went on</i>, and the empress was content.</p>

<p>The second Turkish war having ended in 1783 with the
annexation of the Crimea and Kuban, under the classic
names of Taurida and the Caucasus, Potemkin persuaded
Catherine to go and admire herself in her new dominions,
a thing which she was only too ready to do.</p>

<p>So on the 18th of January, 1787, the imperial <i>cortège</i> set
out from St. Petersburg. There were fourteen carriages
upon sledges for the empress and her court, and one hundred
and sixty for the attendants and baggage. Five
hundred and sixty relays of horses waited them at every
post, and the luxurious carriages flew over the frozen
plains at the rate of a hundred miles a day. Wherever
they stopped, a temporary palace was erected for the empress,
fitted with every luxury, and arranged, as much as
possible, like her palace at St. Petersburg. When they
arrived at Khief, the empress embarked on the Dnieper,
and with a fleet of fifty galleys sailed down the river to
Cherson.</p>

<p>Here money, provisions, and troops had been conveyed
from every part of the empire. The Borysthenes was
covered with magnificent galleys; a hundred and fifty
thousand soldiers were newly equipped; deserts were peopled
for the occasion, and palaces reared for the empress
queen in the midst of trackless wilds.</p>

<p>The king of Poland came to do her homage, and the
Emperor Joseph was content to mingle among the herd of
her courtiers and swell the splendor of her state.</p>

<p>Catherine herself scattered diamonds and honors with
her usual liberality. “In her travelling-carriage she had
a large, green sack, full of gold coins, and her courtiers
were kept busy throwing handfuls out of the window to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
the people, who lay grovelling on the earth as her carriage
passed by.”</p>

<p>After six months spent in this sort of travelling, the
empress returned to St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>As a refuge from the cares of state, Louis XIV. had
built his Trianon, and Frederick the Great his Sans-Souci,
and Catherine II., oppressed like them, reared the splendid
palace of the Hermitage, within whose portals she
laid aside the imperial diadem of all the Russias, and
became a patron of literature and the fine arts.</p>

<p>Beneath a great portal, supported by colossal granite
giants, is the entrance to this Hermitage, over whose steps
have often passed those discarded favorites of the empress-queen,
smothering under forced smiles and honeyed words
their inward rage and indignation; for when Catherine
wearied of her favorites she sent them an order to travel.</p>

<p>“I am tired of him,” she would say; “his ignorance
makes me blush. He can speak nothing but Russian. He
must travel in France and England to learn other languages.”
The courtier who received this intelligence was
not long in preparing his travelling-carriage.</p>

<p>At the Hermitage, Catherine surrounded herself with men
of letters. Here were Lomonozof, the poet; Sumorokof,
the dramatic author; Kheraskof, the writer of tragedies;
Sherebetoff, the historian; and Pallas, the naturalist.</p>

<p>She especially affected the friendship of French writers.
She entertained Diderot with royal magnificence, and purchased
his library; she gave the education of her grandsons,
Alexander and Constantine, to the care of the
republican Laharpe; and she kept up a constant correspondence
with Voltaire. Catherine, herself, had no real
love for the arts; but she patronized them all as subservient
to her glory and her power.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thus she not only had no taste for music, but she
was destitute of ear to distinguish one tune from another,
as she often frankly acknowledged; but nothing less
would serve her than an Italian <i>corps d’opera</i> attached to
her domestic establishment. She had no taste for painting,
yet she purchased at a high price some beautiful collections,
and in the gallery of her palace of the Hermitage
hung some magnificent specimens of the Italian and Flemish
schools, purchased in France and Italy.”</p>

<p>Fifteen miles from the capital of Russia is the beautiful
palace of Czars-Koe-Selo, the Versailles of St. Petersburg.
Catherine II. was very fond of this place, and
spent enormous sums on its embellishment. Originally
every ornament and statue upon the façade of the palace,
which is no less than twelve hundred feet in length, was
heavily plated with gold. After a few years the gilding
wore off, and the contractors engaged to repair it offered
the empress nearly half a million of dollars for the fragments
which remained. But the extravagant Catherine
answered them scornfully:—</p>

<p>“I am not in the habit, gentlemen,” she said, “of selling
my old clothes.”</p>

<p>The main avenue leading to this palace of Czars-Koe-Selo
is ornamented with several Chinese statues. One
morning as the empress was taking her usual promenade
along the avenue, she thought she detected a faint smile
upon the face of one of the heathen images. She observed
it more closely. Surely it was no fancy! the eyes
returned her gaze, and that, too, with an expression
remarkably human.</p>

<p>Catherine II. was not a woman to be afraid of anything.
Accordingly, she walked straight towards the statue, determined
to solve the mystery. She <i>was</i> startled for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
moment, however, when all the figures leaped from their
pedestals, and, hats in hand, begged her to pardon the
little surprise with which they tried to enliven her morning
walk; for her favorite Potemkin and three other courtiers
had, in jest, exactly copied the dress and attitude of
the Chinese figures.</p>

<p>When Prince Bismarck was Prussian ambassador at the
court of Alexander II., he was one day standing with the
Czar at a window of the Peterhof Palace, when he observed
a sentinel in the centre of the lawn with apparently
nothing whatever to guard. Out of curiosity he
inquired of the Czar why the man was stationed there.
Alexander turned to an aide-de-camp.</p>

<p>“Count ——,” said he, “why is that soldier stationed
there?”</p>

<p>“I do not know, your Imperial Majesty.”</p>

<p>The Czar frowned. “Send me the officer in command,”
he said.</p>

<p>The officer appeared. “Prince —— why is a sentinel
stationed on that lawn?”</p>

<p>“I do not know, your Majesty.”</p>

<p>“Not know?” cried the Czar in surprise; “request
then the general commanding the troops at Peterhof to
present himself immediately.”</p>

<p>The general appeared. “General,” said the Czar,
“why is that soldier stationed in yonder isolated place?”</p>

<p>“I beg leave to inform your Majesty that it is in
accordance with an ancient custom,” replied the general
evasively.</p>

<p>“What was the origin of the custom?” inquired Bismarck.</p>

<p>“I—I do not at present recollect,” stammered the
officer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>“Investigate, and report the result,” said Alexander.</p>

<p>So the investigation began, and after three days and
nights of incessant labor, it was ascertained that some <i>eighty
years before</i>, Catherine II., looking out one spring morning
from the windows of this palace of Peterhof, observed
in the centre of this lawn, the first May-flower of the season,
lifting its delicate head above the lately frozen soil.</p>

<p>She ordered a soldier to stand there to prevent its being
plucked. The order was inscribed upon the books; and
thus for eighty years, in summer and in winter, in sunshine
and in storm, a sentinel had stood upon that spot,
no one apparently, until the time of Bismarck, caring to
question the reason of his so doing! Such was, and is,
the absolutism of the government of the Czars!</p>

<p>Catherine had long resolved that one of her granddaughters
should be queen of Sweden.</p>

<p>Gustavus Adolphus, king of Sweden, was already
affianced to a princess of Mecklenburg; but with Catherine
to will was to do, so she contrived to have this marriage
broken off, and brought the young king to St.
Petersburg, where she thought her own consummate
address and the charms of the intended bride would
accomplish the rest.</p>

<p>For once, however, Catherine, the crafty, deceived herself.</p>

<p>Proposals of marriage were speedily made, the treaty
drawn up, the day of betrothment fixed, and a splendid
fête prepared.</p>

<p>The appointed time arrived. The empress, surrounded
by her court, sat in the audience chamber of the Winter
Palace.</p>

<p>Alexandrina, adorned in bridal pomp, stood at the side
of her imperial grandmother; all was in readiness, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
the royal bridegroom came not. They waited—there
was a depressing silence—the bride turned pale, the
empress turned red, the courtiers looked at one another
ominously.</p>

<p>A very different scene, however, was being enacted in
the apartments of the king of Sweden.</p>

<p>The Chancellor Markoff had brought the articles of
marriage to him for his signature. As a mere matter of
form, he read them over rapidly; but the young king,
who listened, became aware that certain articles were
inserted which had not been previously agreed upon.</p>

<p>It was a law of Sweden that the queen of the country
must profess the faith of the nation, and exchange the
Greek for the Lutheran church; but the haughty and imperious
Catherine had decided that <i>her</i> imperial granddaughter
should be made an exception to this law, and
had introduced into the marriage treaty a clause to that
effect.</p>

<p>The king refused to sign the contract.</p>

<p>The chancellor was thunderstruck. A mere boy to
resist the will of the empress; it was preposterous!</p>

<p>He flattered, he entreated, he implored; but all in vain.</p>

<p>Gustavus was immovable; and enraged at the attempt
to deceive him, he flung the papers away.</p>

<p>“No,” he cried furiously, “I will not have it! I will
not sign!” and he shut himself up in his own apartment.</p>

<p>Here was an unexpected <i>contretemps</i>. Who would dare
to relate this pleasing news to the empress-queen, surrounded
by her expectant court?</p>

<p>For some time no one could be prevailed upon to do it,
but finally her favorite, Zuboff, approached Catherine
and whispered to her. The blood rushed to her face and,
attempting to rise, she staggered. But she controlled herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
with a mighty effort, and dismissing her court under
the pretence that the king of Sweden was suddenly indisposed,
retired to her cabinet.</p>

<p>The poor Princess Alexandrina was conducted to her
apartment, where she fainted away. In her tender heart,
a sad and crushing sorrow mingled with mortification and
wounded pride; but Catherine the imperial, Catherine
the imperious,—what were her sensations?</p>

<p>“Braved on her throne, insulted in her court, overreached
in her policy, she could only sustain herself by
the hope of vengeance. Pride and state etiquette forbade
any expression of temper, but the effect on her frame was
perhaps more than fatal. The king of Sweden took his
departure a few days afterward, and Catherine, who from
that instant meditated his destruction, was preparing all
the resources of her great empire for war,—war on every
side,—when the death stroke came, and she fell, like a
sorceress, suffocated among her own poisons.”</p>

<p>Upon the 9th of November, 1796, she was found by
her attendants stretched upon the floor of her apartment,
struck by apoplexy. All attempts to reanimate her were
in vain; and on the following day, without having had one
moment granted her to think, to prepare, or to repent,
this terrible and depraved old woman was hurried out of
the world, with all her sins upon her head.</p>

<p>Such was the end of her whom the Prince de Ligne had
pompously styled “<i>Catherine la Grande</i>.”</p>

<p>Though her political crimes and private sins were such
as to consign her to universal execration, she seems to
have possessed all the graces of an accomplished Frenchwoman.</p>

<p>In her personal deportment, and in the circle of her
court, she was kind, easy, and good-humored. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
serenity of temper and composure of manner were remarkable;
and the contrast between the simplicity of her
deportment in private and the grandeur of her situation
rendered her exceedingly fascinating.</p>

<p>She possessed so many accomplishments, was so elegant
and dignified, and performed with such majesty and decorum
all the external functions of royalty, that none
approached her without respect and admiration; but her
selfishness and her depravity spoiled all, and made her
what we have seen her.</p>

<p>Among all the famous queens of history, there is not
one, save Catherine de’ Medici, whose career is so utterly
devoid of noble acts, so entirely dictated by “selfishness,
lust, and sordid greed,” as that of Catherine II., removed
by the grace of God on the 10th of November, 1796,
from being longer empress of all the Russias, and from
the world which she had done so much to pollute.</p>

<h2>MARIE ANTOINETTE.<br>

<small>A.D. 1755-1793.</small></h2>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">“It is our royal state that yields</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">This bitterness of woe.”—<span class="smcap">Wordsworth.</span></span></div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">IN the grand <i>salon</i> of Trianon stood King Louis XV.,
and near him, on a gold and crimson sofa, sat the
Marchioness of Pompadour. In his hand the king held a
letter which vividly depicted—far too vividly for royal
ears—the desolation of the kingdom and the ruinous
state of the finances; and his Majesty frowned gloomily
as he gazed upon it, for it was not the habit of King
Louis the Well-Beloved to concern himself with the interests
or the wishes of his subjects, or with what took
place within his wide domain of France. Turning suddenly
to Madame de Pompadour, the king read aloud the
missive: “Sire,—Your finances are in the greatest disorder,
and the great majority of states have perished
through this cause; your ministers are without capacity.
Open war is waged against religion. Lose no time in
restoring order to the state of the finances. Embarrassments
necessitate fresh taxes, which grind the people and
induce toward revolt. A time will come, sire, when the
people will be enlightened, and that time is probably
near at hand”; then, turning upon his heel, he added
angrily, “I wish to hear no more about it. Things will
last as they are as long as I shall.” And Madame la
Marquise de Pompadour, rising from her gold and crimson
sofa, cried gayly, “Right, <i>mon roi!</i> Things will last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
as long as we shall, and <i>après nous le deluge!</i>” Madame
la Marquise de Pompadour spoke truly, and when at last
the storm burst in all its fury, and the Duc de Liancourt
announced to Louis XVI. that the Bastile had fallen, and
upon its smouldering ruins a people bid defiance to their
king, his Majesty, astonished and alarmed, exclaimed,
“It is a revolt, then!”</p>

<p>“Nay, sire,” replied Liancourt, “it is a revolution!”</p>

<p>A revolution! Aye, a revolution truly. And King
Louis leaves his splendid, proud Versailles, and Queen
Marie Antoinette bids sad adieu to Trianon. The royal
diadem of France, torn from a kingly brow, is trampled
in the dust, and the blood-red emblem of the Jacobins
appears upon the gilded portals of the Tuileries Palace.
Anarchy! confusion! chaos! Government, Philosophy,
Religion,—all are hurled headlong in the dark abyss, and
fury reigns supreme. But amid this overthrow of men
and things, a daring soul arises who grasps the helm of
state, and stands erect beneath the weight; who chains
revolution in France, and unchains it in the rest of Europe;
and who, having added to his name the brilliant
synonymes of Rivoli, Jena, and Marengo, picks up the
royal crown, and, burnishing it into imperial splendor,
places it triumphantly upon his head, to found for a time
a kind of Roman Empire,—himself the Cæsar of the
nineteenth century.</p>

</div>

<p>All the palace, all Vienna, was full of excitement.
The loyal affection and sentimental lamentation of the
inhabitants gave vent to themselves in cries of grief. For
the fair young daughter of their empress, in whose coming
exaltation they took the utmost pride, who was to do
them such honor and service at the court of France, she
whose bright face ever beamed with smiles, was, on this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
21st of April, 1770, departing on her long journey, and,
as many without much prophetic insight might have perceived,
her difficult career. When the great coach rolled
from the palace courtyard, the girl-bride covered her
face with her hands, which yet could not conceal the tears
that streamed through her slender fingers. Again and
again she turned for a farewell look at the mother, the
home, and the early friends, which she was never to see
again. The carriage rolled away, and Marie Antoinette
Jeanne Josèphe de Lorraine turned her back forever on
the Prater and the Danube, Schönbrunn and the moated
Laxenburg.</p>

<p>Spring-time in sunny France; the birds are singing
merrily, the trees are putting forth their leaves, and all
nature wears a look of happiness and joy. The Château
de Compiègne is filled with guests,—a brilliant assemblage
of the <i>haute noblesse</i> composing the court of Louis
XV. Upon the terrace stands the king, and with him his
three grandsons,—the Dauphin (Louis XVI.), Monsieur
le Comte de Provence (Louis XVIII.), and the Comte d’
Artois (Charles X.),—and an eager, anxious crowd surrounds
them. All gaze in one direction, for Louis, the
Dauphin, awaits his bride,—she who is to be the future
queen of France. But little like a bridegroom looks the
timid, fat Louis, upon this bright spring morning. He
wears an air of resigned indifference, contrasting strongly
with the eagerness of his Majesty, King Louis XV., who,
notwithstanding his sixty years, makes a far more gallant
knight than he. There is a cloud of dust upon the horizon;
the <i>avant-couriers</i> arrive; the king and the Dauphin mount
their horses, and with a numerous retinue ride forth to
meet and welcome the approaching bride. And now the
old state travelling carriage is in sight. Putting spurs to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
his horse, the king leads the way, and, hat in hand, rides
up to the side of the cumbrous vehicle. The door flies
open, and before him in all the freshness of her fifteen
summers is Marie Antoinette Jeanne Josèphe de Lorraine,
Archduchess of Austria. The introductions follow, and
the young bride and her bashful <i>fiancée</i> are conducted
back to Versailles, where, on the 16th of May, 1770, the
nuptial benediction is pronounced by the Archbishop of
Paris, in the chapel of the palace.</p>

<p>Then followed the <i>fêtes</i>, and notwithstanding the exchequer
was in the usual chronic state of exhaustion,
twenty millions of francs—a mighty sum for that period—was
spent upon them.</p>

<p>“<i>Fêtes magnifiques</i>” they were termed, from their surpassing
in splendor anything witnessed in France since
the days of <i>Louis le Grand</i>. For weeks the public rejoicings
continued.</p>

<p>On the 30th of May, they were to close with the <i>fête</i> of
the Ville de Paris, and in the evening a display of illuminations
and fireworks on the Place Louis XV. (now the
Place de la Concorde) which were to surpass all that had
preceded them. Thousands of people filled the square
and all the approaching avenues. Most unfortunately,
through some mismanagement, the scaffolding supporting
the fireworks took fire and burned rapidly. No means
were at hand for extinguishing the flames, and the terror-stricken
multitude rushed in all directions. Crushing
upon each other, hundreds were suffocated by the pressure.
Those that fell were trampled to death. Groans
and screams, and frantic cries for help that none could
render, filled the air. Nothing, in fact, could be done
until the fire had burnt itself out, and the extent of the
calamity was ascertained. The Dauphin and Dauphiness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
distressed at so sad a disaster, gave their entire year’s
allowance towards mitigating the misery that had fallen
upon many poor people; and the “<i>fêtes magnifiques</i>,”
with all their splendor and rejoicing, ending thus in “lamentation,
mourning, and woe,” seem to have been, as it
were, a foreshadowing of the career of her for whom they
had been given,—the unfortunate Marie Antoinette.</p>

<p>“It is the 10th of May, 1774,—a lovely evening following
a bright spring day. The sun has sunk below the
horizon; the brilliant hues of the western sky have faded
into the dark shades of the advancing night, and the
Château of Versailles, in its sombre grandeur, looms
larger in the increasing gloom. On the terrace are
saunterers in earnest conversation; carriages and horses
and a throng of attendants in the marble court. A group
of impatient pages, <i>écuyers</i> booted and spurred, an escort
of the household troops, eager for an order to
mount,—all are watching, with anxious eyes, the flickering
glare of a candle that faintly illumines the window
of a chamber in the château.”</p>

<p>In that chamber lies Louis, once the “well-beloved,”
in the last stages of confluent small-pox. As the clock of
Versailles tolls the hour of twelve, at midnight, the flame
is extinguished; the king is dead! Louis XV. has
breathed his last! Instantly all is movement and animation
in the courtyard, while through the gilded galleries
of Versailles resounds the cry, destined to be heard
never again within its walls, “The king is dead! Long
live the king!” as, with a noise like thunder, the courtiers
rush from the antechamber of the dead monarch to
the apartments of the Dauphin, to hail <i>him</i> king of
France. This extraordinary tumult, in the silence of
midnight, conveyed to Louis and Marie Antoinette the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
first intelligence that the crown of France had fallen
upon their brows; and, overcome by the violence of
their emotions, they fell upon their knees exclaiming,
“O God! guide us, protect us; we are too young to
govern!”</p>

<p>Preparations had been made for an immediate flight;
for all alike were anxious to escape the infectious air
of the <i>petits appartements</i> and <i>grande galerie</i>, whose
deadly atmosphere claimed yet a hecatomb of victims.
Three hours after the king’s death Versailles was a
desert; for the young king and the queen, with the
whole court in retinue, had set out in their carriages for
Choisy. A few under-servants and priests of the “inferior
clergy” remained to pray beside the body, which
was ultimately placed in a coffin filled with lime, thrust
into a hunting-carriage, and, followed by a few attendants,
with no signs of mourning, the <i>cortège</i> set out, “<i>au
grand trot</i>” for St. Denis.</p>

<p>There were none to mourn the departed monarch; and
in an hour Louis the Well-Beloved was forgotten, or
remembered but to be despised. But a single Fontenoy
veteran, inspired by the memories of other days, rushed
forward and presented arms as the scanty funeral <i>cortège</i>
of the once vaunted hero of a brilliant fight passed through
the gates of Versailles, in the dead of night, on the 13th
of May, 1774. “What matters it,” murmured the old
soldier, regretfully; “he was at Fontenoy!”</p>

<p>“It was a momentous crisis in the history of the nation
when Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette ascended the
throne of France. The time had arrived when the
abuses of the Old Régime could no longer be tolerated,
and sweeping reforms were demanded. The nation,
hitherto politically a nullity, had awakened to a sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
of its rights; while absolute sovereignty, with its arbitrary
dictum, ‘<i>L’état c’est moi</i>,’ and its right divine
to govern wrong, had lost its prestige, and had apparently
no prospect of regaining it.”</p>

<p>The people, indeed, regarded the young monarch as
the “hope of the nation,” and named him “<i>Louis le
Desire</i>,”—a testimony to the ardor with which they had
looked forward to his accession. And it is probable that,
had a more able pilot—“a king more a king” than that
feeblest of monarchs, Louis XVI.—been called to the
helm at that period, “the vessel of state might have
been safely guided through the shoals and quicksands
surrounding her, and escaped the eddies of that devastating
whirlpool in which she was eventually engulfed.”
Indeed, if sincerely wishing to see his people prosperous
and happy could have made them so, France would have
had no more beneficent ruler than Louis XVI. But his
good wishes and intentions were rendered of no avail by
his utter want of energy and ability to carry them out.
Infirm of purpose at the first, he remained so to the end.
The decree, “Let there be light,” unfortunately, never
went forth to quicken his mental faculties. The queen,
on the other hand, possessed all the courage and resolution
of her imperial mother, Maria Theresa; and, had
she been able to control affairs, the revolution would
have been crushed in its infancy with an iron hand.
Again, had the king been able to hold to his milder
measures, to maintain on the following day that which
he had declared the day before, it is possible that France
might have passed quietly from an absolute to a constitutional
monarchy. But the self-will and determination of
the one, and the weakness and instability of the other,
rendered a union of ideas impossible and the revolution
inevitable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>Little was known by the nation at large of the mental
qualities of the young king. He was now in his twentieth
year; and it had been noised among the people that he
had inherited all the virtues of his father, “<i>Le Grand
Dauphin</i>” to which were added the frugal tastes, the
genial temper, and the air of <i>bonhomie</i> to which the gallant
Henry IV. owed so much of his popularity.</p>

<p>“No wonder, then, that the accession of Louis XVI.
was hailed throughout France with general delight, or
that the enthusiastic people—their many expected reforms
already conceded in imagination—should have
written in conspicuous characters, ‘RESURREXIT,’
beneath the statue of the gallant Henry, whose jovial
humor and pliant conscience enabled him to gratify his
Catholic subjects with his presence at a <i>Te Deum</i>.”</p>

<p>When the king made his public entry into the capital,
the joyous demonstrations of the Parisians affected him
deeply. “What have I done,” he exclaimed, “that they
should love me so much?” Ah, Louis! you have as yet
done nothing; but much, very much, is expected from
you!</p>

<p>But Louis XVI. possessed no energy; and the torpid
action of his mind was but too plainly evinced by the
sluggish inactivity of his heavy frame, as, stolid in his
immense corpulence, he sat lolling in his chariot.</p>

<p>Perhaps, in their eagerness for reforms, the Parisians
displayed unreasonable impatience. But when, a few
weeks later, the young monarch again passed through
Paris, he remarked—though unfortunately the lesson
was lost on him—that the acclamations of the people
were far less frequent and fervid than on the former occasion.
And his eyes were filled with tears when he perceived
that the conspicuously displayed “RESURREXIT”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
was transferred from the statue of the gallant Henry to
that of the slothful Louis XV. Still, with all his vices,
Louis the Well-Beloved, on those rare occasions when
he appeared in public, had always commanded the respectful
homage of his subjects, simply by the dignity of
his bearing. By the same means he imposed silence on
his courtiers, when, in license of speech, they infringed
the limits within which it was sometimes his <i>bon plaisir</i>
to restrain them. Occasionally, too, when the parliament
opposed his edicts, or the dissentient opinion of a minister
roused him from his habitual indolence, he could at
once assume the arbitrary tone, the “<i>je le veux</i>” of the
absolute monarch, and carry out his purposes with all
the <i>hauteur</i> of his royal ancestor, the <i>Grand Monarque</i>.
“And it is probable that his handsome person and majestic
air—for, whatever may have been his shortcomings
in other and more essential qualities, in appearance
he was every inch a king—may have gone far in preventing
the utter extinction of the enthusiastic affection which
on several occasions during his reign the people so singularly,
yet so generally, expressed towards the royal <i>débauché</i>.
A lingering spark of that once ardent feeling
must have smouldered on in their hearts to the end; for,
grievously oppressed though they were, and vicious as
they knew him to be, they still toiled on under their burdens,
not exactly uncomplainingly, yet in a spirit of toleration
towards him; while the yearned-for relief was, as if
by the tacit consent of his subjects, to be claimed only
from his successor.” Truly, indications were not wanting
of the approaching storm. But “<i>Après nous le deluge!</i>”
cried Madame de Pompadour, gayly; and the king and
the court echoed the cry. Madame la Marquise was
right. The deluge came; and the royal authority which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
Richelieu, Mazarin, and Louis XIV. had raised to such
gigantic heights, and which Louis XV. had so shamefully
abused, was hurled prostrate in the dust.</p>

<p>Bright shines the sun on this 10th day of June, 1775;
and, heavy in its massive architecture, the grand old
cathedral of Rheims looms up against the clear blue sky.
The interior is hung with crimson cloth of gold. On the
right of the altar, arrayed in their red and violet robes,
point lace, gold crosses, chains, and mitres, sit the great
grandees of the church. On the left, in their mantles of
state, stand the temporal peers of the realm, and a
brilliant crowd of gold-embroidered naval and military
uniforms surrounds them; while above, in the lofty galleries
of the nave, in the midst of pearls and diamonds,
gold, and precious stones, and lofty, waving plumes, is
Marie Antoinette, proud and radiant, surrounded by the
ladies of her retinue.</p>

<p>For on this 10th day of June, “good Louis XVI.,” as
the country people say, is to be crowned. Maria Theresa
was anxious that Marie Antoinette should be crowned
with the king; but she evinced not the slightest inclination,
and, indeed, it was only at Vienna that such an
event seems to have been expected or desired. But
among the glittering throng which fills the cathedral, one
sees not the king. He waits in the sacristy, whither two
of the dignitaries of the church proceed to lead him to
the front of the altar. The door forthwith flies open, and
Louis XVI. appears in all the insignia of royalty. The
mantle of state is placed upon his shoulders, and anointing
him with the seven unctions of the <i>sacre</i>, the archbishop
cries aloud, “<i>Vivat rex in aeternum!</i>” The grand old
organ peals forth as he approaches the altar, and the
fresh young voices of the choristers swell through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
aisles and naves as they sing the choral service. How
startling is the effect when, during a <i>sotto voce</i> passage of
the service, the archbishop places the crown upon the
king’s head, and he, suddenly raising his hand, thrusts it
aside, exclaiming, “<i>Elle me gêne!</i>” Poor Louis! Truly
he was destined to find it <i>gênant</i> in every sense. Henry
III. had said, “<i>Elle me pique!</i>” All knew what had
been his end. “The queen, who had been a deeply interested
spectator of the scene, exhibited so much agitation
at the moment of the king’s exclamation, that she
was near fainting, and was conducted from the cathedral.”
The ceremony is concluded; and the clanging of bells,
the roaring of cannon, the lively chirping of thousands of
birds, freed from their cages, to symbolize the “<i>vieilles
franchises</i>” of France, and the tumultuous shouts of
“<i>Vive le roi!</i>” proclaim to the multitude that “<i>Louis
le Desire</i>,” is crowned king of France.</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette had been reared in all the freedom of
the Austrian court, and it was some time before she could
habituate herself to the etiquette-laden atmosphere of
Versailles, where every look, every motion, every gesture,
were governed alike by the inexorable rules of <i>la grande
politesse</i>, laid down with such precision and exactitude by
King Louis XIV. From the cradle to the tomb, in sickness
and in health, at table, at council, in the chase, in
the army, in the midst of their court, and in their private
apartments, kings and princes, in France, were governed
by ceremonial rules. The pomp and glitter at Versailles
dazzled the beholder. There all breathed of greatness,
of exaltation, and of unapproachableness; and the people,
awestruck at the splendor and gorgeous trappings of
royalty, fell prostrate before the throne.</p>

<p>Madame Campan thus describes her feelings upon first
entering this charmed spot:—<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>

<p>“The queen, Marie Leckzinska, wife of Louis XV.,
died just before I was presented at court. The grand
apartments hung with black, the great chairs of state
raised on several steps and surmounted by a canopy
adorned with plumes, the caparisoned horses, the immense
retinue in court mourning, the enormous shoulder-knots
embroidered with gold and silver spangles which
decorated the coats of the pages and footmen,—all this
magnificence had such an effect upon my senses, that I
could scarcely support myself when introduced to the
princesses.</p>

<p>“How well was the potent magic of grandeur and dignity,
which ought to surround sovereigns, understood at
Versailles!</p>

<p>“Marie Antoinette, dressed in white, with a plain straw
hat, and a little switch in her hand, walking on foot, and
followed by a single servant, through the walks leading
to the Petit Trianon, would never have thus disconcerted
me. And I believe this extreme simplicity was the
<i>first</i> and only <i>real</i> fault of all those with which she is
reproached.”</p>

<p>The illusions of etiquette were necessary to Louis XV.
Louis XIV. might have dispensed with them. His throne,
resplendent with the triumph of arms, literature, and the
fine arts, was glorious enough without them. But he
would be more than a great king, this mighty Louis!
And so this demi-god, when age and calamity had taught
him that he was but human, endeavored to conceal the
ravages of time and of disease beneath the vain pomp of
ceremony. He, Louis “the Magnificent,” the most accomplished
of gentlemen, habitually exacted and received
from the noblest of his realm adulations and menial
services better becoming the palace of Ispahan than
the Château of Versailles.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>“All service to the king and queen, and, in a lower
degree, to the Dauphin and Dauphiness, was regarded as
an honor to the persons serving,—an honor to be keenly
contended for by persons of the highest rank, no matter
what delay, or inconvenience, or unutterable weariness of
spirit was experienced by the individuals thus served.”
Her Majesty the queen could not pass from one apartment
to the other, without being followed by the lords and
ladies of her retinue. The ceremonies of rising and dressing
were accompanied by laws and rites as irrevocable as
the decrees of the Medes and Persians.</p>

<p>The <i>petites entrées</i> and the <i>grandes entrées</i> had each
their appropriate ceremonies. At the former, none but
the physicians, reader, and secretary had the privilege of
being present, whether her Majesty breakfasted in bed or
out of it. At the <i>grande toilette</i>, the toilet table, which
was always the most splendid piece of furniture in the
apartment, was brought forward, and the queen surrendered
herself to the hands of her hairdresser. Then followed
the <i>grande entrée;</i> sofas were ranged in circles for
the ladies of the household. The members of the royal
family, the princes of the blood, and all the great officers,
having the privilege, paid their court. Only <i>grandes
dames</i> of the <i>haute noblesse</i> could occupy the <i>tabouret</i> in
the royal presence. There were well-defined degrees of
royal salutation,—a smile, a nod, a bending of the body,
or leaning forward as if to rise, which was the highest
form of acknowledgment. If her Majesty wished her
gloves, or a glass of water, what she desired was brought
by a page upon a gold salver, and the salver was presented
in turn with solemn precision, according to the
rank of the persons present, by the <i>femme de chambre</i> to
the lady-in-waiting; but if the chief <i>dame d’honneur</i>, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
a princess of the blood, or any member of the royal family
entered at the time, the salver was returned to the <i>femme
de chambre</i>, and by her offered again to the <i>dame d’honneur</i>,
or to the princess, that she might have the privilege
of presentation, till, at last, the article reached its
destination.</p>

<p>One winter’s morning, Marie Antoinette, who was partially
disrobed, was just about to put on her body linen.
The lady-in-waiting held it ready unfolded for her. The
<i>dame d’honneur</i> entered. Etiquette demanded that she
should present the robe. Hastily slipping off her gloves,
she took the garment, but at that moment a rustling was
heard at the door. It was opened, and in came Madame
la Duchesse d’Orleans. She must now be the bearer of
the garment. But the laws of etiquette would not allow
the <i>dame d’honneur</i> to hand the linen directly to Madame
la Duchesse. It must pass down the various grades of
rank to the lowest, and by her be presented to the highest.
The linen was consequently passed back again from one
to another, till it was finally placed in the hands of the
duchess. She was just upon the point of conveying it to
its proper destination, when suddenly the door opened,
and the Comtesse de Provence entered. Again the linen
passed from hand to hand until it reached Madame la Comtesse.
She, perceiving the uncomfortable position of the
queen, who sat shivering with cold, without stopping to remove
her gloves, placed the linen upon her shoulders. Her
Majesty, however, was quite unable to restrain her impatience,
and exclaimed, “How disagreeable, how tiresome!”
Such was the etiquette of the court of Versailles,
and its inexorable rules governed alike every
action in the lives of the king and queen, while the
cavaliers and <i>grandes dames</i> observed with the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
minuteness every punctilio of <i>la grande politesse et la grande
galanterie</i>, that by so doing they might widen the gulf already
existing between them and the new ideas of <i>liberté</i>
and <i>égalité</i> which were beginning to pervade the realm.</p>

<p>“You love flowers; I give you a bouquet of them by
offering you Le Petit Trianon entirely for your own private
use. There you may reign sole mistress; for the Trianons,
by right, belong to you, having always been the residence
of the favorites of the kings of France.” For Louis XVI.
this speech was a great effort of gallantry. It delighted
Marie Antoinette. Here, then, was that for which she
had so often longed; a place to which she could retire
from the cares of state, and throw aside the pomps and
punctilios of etiquette. She loved not the grand old
gardens of Versailles, with their terraces and clipped yews.
She would have an English garden of the day, with its
thickets, waterfalls, and rustic bridges, such as the Prince
de Ligny had made at <i>Bel-œil</i> and the Marquis de Caraman
at Roissy. <i>Le grand simple</i> is to take the place of
<i>le grand magnifique</i>, and attired in white muslin, with a
a plain straw hat, and followed by a single attendant, the
queen roams through the gardens and groves of the Petit
Trianon. Through the lanes and byways she chases the
butterfly, picks flowers free as a peasant girl, and leaning
over the fences, chats with the country maids as they
milk the cows.</p>

<p>This freedom from restraint was etiquette at the court
of Vienna; it was barbarism at the court of Versailles.
The courtiers were amazed, the ceremony-stricken dowagers
were shocked; and Paris, France, and Europe,
were filled with stories of the waywardness and eccentricities
of Marie Antoinette. And Mesdames, the king’s
aunts, from their retreat at Bellevue, and Madame du<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
Barry, from her domain of Luviciennes, lost no opportunity
to gather reports unfavorable to the reputation of
the queen, and spread them far and wide.</p>

<p>Still another surprise was in store for the nobility, for
upon one occasion, at Trianon, when the queen seated
herself, she requested in a lively, nonchalant manner the
whole of the ladies, without distinction, who formed her
intimate circle, to seat themselves also! What a blow to
those who held so dear the privileges they derived from
distinction of office and superiority of rank! <i>La haute</i>
and <i>la petite noblesse</i>, in spite of their cherished distinctions,
<i>all</i> are to sit down together! It is terrible! How
many enemies are made, and allies added to the circles at
Bellevue and Luviciennes, by that little act! Poor
thoughtless Marie Antoinette!</p>

<p>But she proposed to reign at Trianon, not as queen of
France, but simply as a lady of the manor, surrounded by
her friends. And so she built the Swiss cottages, with
their thatched roofs and rustic balconies; for it was her
good pleasure that she, her king, and her friends, should
be country people for the nonce. The queen’s cottage
stood in the centre, and she was the <i>fermière</i>. The king
was the miller, and occupied the mill, with its joyous tick-tack.
Monsieur le Comte de Provence, figured as schoolmaster,
while the Comte d’Artois was in his element as
gamekeeper. However, one may be sure that these simple
country folk had no want of retainers to do their behests.
In the dairy, where the cream was put in the blue
and white porcelain of Trianon, on marble tables, diligent
dairymaids skimmed and churned, and displayed fresh
butter and eggs. Down by the lake were more masqueraders,—washerwomen
this time; and Madame la Comtesse
de Chalons beat the clothes with ebony beaters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
In the stable, the sheep, unconscious of the honor to be
done them, stood ready for clipping with golden shears.
“The Duc de Guines might not assist at this, because he
was so stout and so desperately bent on resorting to art
to restrain his bulk, that his valet, in selecting his master’s
garments every morning, was fain to ask, ‘Does my
lord the Duke sit down to-day?’ But there were other
helpers,—the big, jovial Duc de Coigny, and the rough-voiced,
stiff-jointed Comte d’Adhémar, who could, at least,
hoist sacks of corn up the mahogany steps to the granary.”
<i>Madame la Fermière</i> distributed refreshments as she
overlooked and encouraged her workers. And so the
dainty work, which was the idlest pastime, went on to the
accompaniment of gay jests and rippling laughter.</p>

<p>This descent from the throne, which was so congenial
to the queen, was loudly condemned. In their first efforts
for reform the people had no wish to detract from the
hereditary splendor of the crown, or the “divinity,” which
for so many centuries had hedged the kings of France.
It was the king and queen who took the first steps. Winter
comes, and with it a heavy fall of snow, and Marie
Antoinette longs again for the merry sleigh rides of
Vienna. “The old court sledges are brought forth—these
being professedly economical times—for examination
as to their possibly serviceable condition. A glance,
however, suffices to show that disuse and neglect have put
them completely <i>hors de service</i>.” So new ones of great
magnificence are prepared, with “abundance of painting
and gilding, trappings of embroidered crimson leather and
velvet, with innumerable tinkling bells of gold or silver.”
The horses, with nodding plumes and gorgeous caparisons,
dazzled the eyes of the Parisians as they swept
through the Champs Élysées, drawing their loads of lords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
and ladies enveloped in furs. The people frowned disapprovingly.
It was a new amusement—an innovation; and
angry, envious tongues declared that the “<i>Autrichienne</i>
had taken advantage of the rigor of the season which had
caused such widespread misery to introduce her Austrian
pastimes into the capital of France.”</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette was imprudent, very imprudent; that
was her only crime. But much allowance must be made
for one, who, at the age of fifteen years, was made <i>la
premiere dame</i> in a court the most gorgeous, and, after
that of Catherine II. of Russia, the most dissolute, in
Europe.</p>

<p>The people had already begun to compute the cost of
equipages, palaces, crown jewels, and courtiers. And
some few of the <i>grands seigneurs</i>, even, had begun to
recognize the growing power of the <i>vox populi;</i> but Marie
Antoinette did not yet know that public opinion was of
any importance to her. “The slanderous tongues of
Mesdames and the pious circle of Bellevue, the innuendoes
of Luviciennes, and the insidious attacks of Monsieur le
Comte de Provence,—all this she understood, and resented.
It seemed a matter of course that it should be
thus; but the right of the <i>people</i> to interfere with her
amusements and to call in question their propriety, was
something she could not understand.” Alas! poor queen;
the dreadful significancy of that expression “THE PEOPLE,”
and the vengeful acts to which an infuriated populace
could be driven, were two terrible lessons she had yet
to learn.</p>

<p>On the 22d of October, 1781, a child is born at Versailles.
The king advances towards the queen’s couch;
with a profound bow, and in a voice that falters with
emotion, he exclaims, “Madame, you have fulfilled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
dearest wishes of my heart and the anxious hopes of the
nation; you are the mother of a <i>Dauphin</i>.” Nothing could
exceed the public rejoicings; the triumph became well-nigh
frantic. For it is recorded that their superabundant
joy found expression in a sort of delirium,—people of all
grades, and who had no previous acquaintance with each
other, indulging in fraternal embraces in the street. The
king himself went through a similar display of excessive
joy. He laughed, he wept, the tears streaming down
his fat face. He ran in and out of the antechamber, presenting
his hand to kiss or to shake—or both, if they
pleased—to all and each indiscriminately, from the solemn
<i>grandees</i>, who were there to attest the birth, to the
humblest lackey in attendance. “The royal infant, splendidly
arrayed and with the grand cross of St. Louis on his
breast, was placed in his satin and point-lace bassinet to
receive the homage of the great officers of state. It is
recorded that he replied in a most suitable manner to
the many flattering speeches addressed to him; and this
being the first opportunity he had had of exhibiting the
power of his lungs, he availed himself of it freely.”
Madame Royale had been born three years before; two
other children were subsequently added,—the Duc de
Normandie, and the Princess Sophie; but only Madame
Royale and the Duc de Normandie were destined to survive
to endure those woes which eventually overwhelmed
the royal family.</p>

<p>Marie Antoinette was now in the flower of her beauty,
on which French biographers love to dwell. Tilly said,
“Her eyes recalled all the changes of the waves of the
sea, and seemed made to reveal and reflect the blue of
the sky.” Her fine throat and the lofty carriage of her
head were remarkable; and she once said, laughingly, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
Madame Le Brun, “If I were not a queen, should not I
look insolent?”</p>

<p>“As one would have offered a chair to another woman,
one would have offered a throne to her; and when she
descended the marble staircase at Versailles, preceded by
the officers who announced her approach, saluted in the
great court by the beating of drums and the presentation
of arms, all heads were uncovered respectfully, all hearts
were filled with admiration of the woman, as well as with
loyalty to the queen.”</p>

<p>Who shall tell the true story of the diamond necklace?
It will probably never be told. The papers of the Cardinal
de Rohan, which might have thrown much light upon
the subject, were unfortunately destroyed. Little did
Marie Antoinette think, as she entered Strasburg in triumph
on her marriage journey, that she would encounter,
in the magnificent robes of a cardinal’s coadjutor, a man
who was to prove her deadly foe,—the insolent and profligate
Prince Louis de Rohan. He had been ambassador
at Vienna, where he had disgusted Maria Theresa by his
profligacy and arrogance. She had procured his withdrawal.
He had not been allowed to appear at the court
of Versailles; and now for ten long years he had fretted
and fumed under a sense of the royal displeasure. Boehmer,
the crown jeweller, had, for a period of years, been
collecting and assorting the stones which should form an
incomparable necklace, in row upon row, pendants and
tassels of lustrous diamonds, till the price had reached
the royal pitch of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
This costly “collar” he offered to the king, who
would willingly have bought it for the queen had she
desired it; but Marie Antoinette replied, that if the
money were to be spent, it had better be used in fitting a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
frigate for the royal navy. His Most Christian Majesty
concurred exactly in this sentiment, and, returning the
necklace to Boehmer with the words, “We have more
need of ships than of diamonds,” thought no more about
the matter. Not so did the Cardinal de Rohan, and the
<i>intrigante</i> Madame de Lamotte. They had made up their
minds to possess the three hundred and fifty thousand
dollars represented by the glittering gems. So they laid
their clever heads together, and, by forging notes of the
queen and sundry other little plots which were wonderfully
successful, obtained the necklace, leaving Boehmer
to look to the queen for payment. Of course payment
was not forthcoming, and in his distress the jeweller related
the affair to Madame Campan, telling her he feared
he had been duped. Madame Campan proceeded at once
to Versailles, and laid the matter before the queen. It
was the 15th of August, 1784, Assumption day, and Prince
Louis de Rohan, in full pontificals, and wearing the Grand
Cross of St. Louis, arrived at Versailles to perform mass
in the royal chapel; but he had scarcely entered the <i>Œil
de Bœuf</i>, when he was summoned to the cabinet of the
king. As he entered, Louis XVI. turned upon him suddenly,
inquiring, “You have purchased diamonds of
Boehmer?” “Yes, sire,” was the trembling reply.
“What have you done with them?” the king added.
“I thought,” replied the cardinal, “that they had been
delivered to the queen.” “Who commissioned you to
make this purchase?” “The Comtesse de Lamotte,”
was the reply; “she handed me a letter from her Majesty,
requesting me to obtain the necklace for her. Indeed, I
thought I was obeying her Majesty’s wishes by taking this
business upon myself.”</p>

<p>“How could you imagine, sir,” indignantly interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
Marie Antoinette, “that I should have selected <i>you</i> for
such a purpose, when I have not addressed you for eight
years, and how could you suppose that I should have
acted through the mediation of such a character as
Madame la Comtesse de Lamotte?”</p>

<p>The cardinal was in the most violent agitation; he
drew from his pocket a letter, directed to the Comtesse
de Lamotte, and signed with the queen’s name. Her
Majesty glanced at it, and instantly pronounced it a forgery,
and the king added, “How could you, a prince of
the church and grand almoner of my household, not have
detected it? This letter is signed <i>Marie Antoinette de
France</i>. Queens sign their names short; it is not even
the queen’s handwriting.” Then drawing a letter from
his pocket, and handing it to De Rohan, he said, “Are
you the author of that letter?”</p>

<p>The cardinal turned pale, and, leaning upon a table,
appeared as though he would fall to the floor.</p>

<p>“I have no wish, Monsieur le Cardinal,” the king
added, “to find you guilty; explain to me this enigma;
account for all these manœuvres with Boehmer. Where
did you obtain these securities and these promissory
notes, signed in the queen’s name?”</p>

<p>The cardinal was trembling in every nerve: “Sire, I
am too much agitated now to answer your Majesty; give
me a little time to collect my thoughts.” “Go into my
cabinet,” replied the king; “you will there find papers,
pens, and ink. At your leisure, <i>write</i> what you desire to
to say to me.”</p>

<p>But the written statements of M. de Rohan were as
unsatisfactory as his verbal ones. In half an hour he
returned with a paper covered with blottings, alterations,
and erasures. Louis’ anger was aroused, and, throwing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
open the folding doors, he cried out in imperious tones,—very
unusual for him,—which resounded through the
<i>Œil de Bœuf</i> and <i>grande galerie:</i> “Arrest the Cardinal
de Rohan!” The Baron de Bretuil approached through
the crowd of astonished courtiers, and, summoning the
officer on guard, he indicated the cardinal with the words,
“<i>De par le roi, Monseigneur</i>, you are arrested; at your
risk, officer.” But, before the cardinal could be removed,
he had spoken three words in German to one of his
officials, and given him a slip of paper. The horse on
which the man rode post haste to the cardinal’s palace in
Paris, fell dead in the courtyard; but the red portfolio,
containing the supposed autographs of the queen’s letters,
lay in ashes before it could be sealed up in the name of
justice and of the king. The cardinal was taken to the
Bastile. More arrests followed, including that of the
Comtesse de Lamotte. For nine months the trial lasted
before the Council of the Grand Chambre. The Pope
protested against a prince of the church being made
accountable for his acts to any but the highest ecclesiastical
tribunal (an assembly of the cardinals at Rome);
while the <i>haute noblesse</i> looked on the cause of the Prince
de Rohan as their own, considering the rights and privileges
of their rank intrenched upon, when a near relative
of the princes of the blood was put on his trial before the
Council of the Grand Chambre. So the cardinal was
eventually acquitted, and Madame de Lamotte alone
was severely punished by flogging and branding on both
shoulders.</p>

<p>Their Majesties were chagrined at the acquittal of M.
de Rohan and shocked at the punishment of the countess.
The former was an insult to the king, the latter to
the queen; for Madame de Lamotte boasted a descent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
from the House of Valois and royal blood within her
veins. Such was the affair of the Diamond Necklace,
which, though apparently trivial in itself, involved consequences
of the most momentous importance.</p>

<p>“Mind that miserable affair of the necklace,” said
Talleyrand; “I should be in nowise surprised if it
should overturn the French monarchy.”</p>

<p>Whoever were the guilty ones, Marie Antoinette was
entirely innocent. She, however, experienced all the
ignominy she could have encountered had she been involved
in the deepest guilt, and the affair furnished a fine
theme for the malevolence of Bellevue and Luviciennes.</p>

<p>Respect for royalty was on the wane. The king, of
course, had shared with the queen in the disrespect which
Mesdames, his aunts, were desirous should rest on her
alone; and the insulting conduct towards him of his
brothers, Monsieur le Comte de Provence and the libertine,
the Comte d’Artois, who, according to an eye-witness,
“on occasions of great state or solemnity, will
pass before the king twenty times, push him aside, tread
on his feet, and this, apparently, without any thought of
apology or excuse,” together with the affair of the Diamond
Necklace, were well calculated to debase him further
in the eyes of his courtiers and in public opinion.
Nowhere was this more evident than when the court
assembled in the Grand Gallery of Versailles, where
once the <i>Grand Monarque</i> held his <i>réunions</i> called
“<i>Appartements</i>.” At such times, “a stranger would have
found it difficult to recognize the king by any particular
attention or any deference paid to him.” What, then,
must have been the agonized sensations of the perturbed
spirit of the superb <i>Louis Quatorze</i>, if ever, to look on
his degenerate posterity, he revisited the scene of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
former greatness and grandeur, where once he sat enthroned
like Jupiter among the inferior gods, and where
all around him were but too willing to fall down in the
dust at his royal feet, had it been his “<i>bon plaisir</i>” that
they should do so! Ah, those were palmy days for
church and state!</p>

<p>Brightly dawned the 5th of May, 1789, and Versailles,
with its tapestries, its garlands, and its throngs of gayly
dressed visitors, wore a festive, smiling air. To many it
was indeed a joyous day,—a day of hope; for the king
had granted the States General. Such an assemblage
France had not witnessed for more than a hundred and
fifty years. No wonder, then, it was looked forward to
as the dawn of national liberty. But as the procession
winds its way along the vast streets of Versailles, the
people see, with pain, how marked are the distinctions of
rank and costume which divide <i>their</i> representatives from
the nobles and the clergy. To the episcopal purple, the
croziers, and grand mantles of the dignitaries of the
church succeed the long black robes of the “inferior
clergy.” Then in all the splendor of velvet and cloth of
gold, lace ruffles and cravats, floating plumes and mantles
of state, come the <i>haute noblesse</i>. Then follow the
modest Third Estate of the realm; the absence of finery
in their humble garb is atoned for in the eyes of the populace
who receive them with hearty cheers, which they
have refused the nobles who have preceded them. One
only is generally known. It is the “plebian count” de
Mirabeau. The <i>cortège</i> of the princes, who are surrounded
by courtiers, is allowed to pass in silence. Louis
XVI. appears; as usual, he moves without dignity, simple,
in spite of his Cross of St. Louis and his <i>cordon bleu</i>.
Marie Antoinette moves with her accustomed majesty, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
her face wears an anxious look. Her lips are closely
pressed, as if in a vain effort to dissemble her trouble,
for not only is her Dauphin, whose birth had been so
proudly hailed, at the point of death, but she is this day
greeted, not with the old loyal shouts of “<i>Vive la reine!</i>”
but with new insulting cries of “<i>Vive d’Orleans!</i>” Monsieur
le Comte de Provence is grave and pensive, and
apparently impressed with the importance of the occasion.
He walks with difficulty, owing to his extreme corpulency.
The Comte d’Artois shows evident signs of <i>ennui</i> and
bad temper, and casts disdainful glances to the right and
left upon the crowd that lines the streets, and so,
although they little think it, those high-born men and
women march onward to their fate. “For although no
really hostile sentiments can be said to have <i>then</i> animated
that vast throng, nevertheless, alike among those
who formed the procession and those who were only its
spectators, there was a lurking latent feeling that something
strange, something hitherto unknown, coming from
the past and pressing on to the future, was moving onwards
towards France.”</p>

<p>It was the revolution to be decreed by the <i>Étâts Généraux</i>.
On the 23d of June, the king held a <i>séance royale</i>
at Versailles. It was attended with all the <i>appareil</i> and
state of the “bed of justice” of the old régime. The
<i>noblesse</i> had determined, if possible, to crush the Third
Estate; but the king hardly knew how to utter the arrogant
and defiant words which had been put into his mouth.
It was the lamb attempting to imitate the roar of the lion.
“<i>Je veux, j’ordonne, je commande</i>” was the burden of
the king’s speech, which was read by the keeper of the
seals, upon his knees. One may imagine how it was received
by the <i>Tiers État</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>

<p>The address closed with the following words: “I command
you, gentlemen, immediately to disperse, and to
repair to-morrow morning to the chambers appropriate to
your order.”</p>

<p>The king and his attendant court left the hall. The
<i>noblesse</i> and the clergy followed him. Exultation beamed
upon their faces, for they thought that the <i>Tiers État</i> was
now effectually crushed. The Commons remained in their
seats. The crisis had arrived. There was now no alternative
but resistance or submission, rebellion or servitude.
The Marquis de Brézé, grand master of ceremonies, perceiving
that the assembly did not retire, advanced to the
centre of the hall, and in a loud, authoritative voice,—a
voice at whose command nearly fifty thousand troops
were ready to march,—demanded, “Did you hear the
command of the king?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” responded Mirabeau, with a glaring eye
and a thunder tone; “we have heard the king’s command,
and you who have neither seat nor voice in this house are
not the one to remind us of his speech. Go, tell those
who sent you, that we are here by the power of the people,
and that nothing shall drive us hence but the power
of the bayonet.”</p>

<p>And the grand master of ceremonies went out backwards
from the presence of the orator of the people, as it
was etiquette to go from the presence of the king.</p>

<p>The <i>noblesse</i>, in the meantime, were in exultation. They
deemed the popular movement effectually crushed, and
hastened with their congratulations to the queen. Marie
Antoinette was much elated, and presenting to them the
Dauphin, she exclaimed, “I intrust him to the nobility.”</p>

<p>The Marquis de Brézé now entered the council-chamber,
to inform the king that the deputies still continued their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
sitting, and asked for orders. The king walked impatiently
once or twice up and down the floor, and then replied
hastily, “Very well! leave them alone.” Louis
XIV. would have sent every man of them to the Bastile
or the scaffold; but the days of Louis XIV. were no more.
It was the 14th of July, 1789. All Paris was in confusion.
Mobs ransacked the city in pursuit of arms. Every
sword, pistol, and musket from private residences were
brought forward. The royal arsenal, containing mainly
curiosities and suits of ancient armor, was sacked, and
while all the costly objects of interest were left untouched,
every available weapon was taken away. But why all
this turmoil, terror, and excitement? Out at Versailles
was Marshal Broglie, proud and self-confident, in conference
with the court, and having at his command fifty
thousand troops abundantly armed and equipped, all of
whom could in a few hours be concentrated in the streets
of Paris. Upon the <i>Champ de Mars</i>, Benseval had assembled
his force of several thousand Swiss and German
troops, cavalry and artillery, and at any moment this
combined force might be expected to pour, in the king’s
name, upon his “good city of Paris,” and chastise his
rebellious subjects with terrible severity; while the enormous
fortress of the Bastile, with its walls forty feet
thick at the base and fifteen at the top, rising with its
gloomy towers one hundred and twenty feet in the air,
with its cannon charged with grapeshot, already run out at
every embrasure, commanded the city; while that remained
in the hands of the enemy there was no safety. Could
the Bastile be taken? Preposterous! It was as unassailable
as the rock of Gibraltar. The mob surged around
the Hotel de Ville demanding arms and the immediate
establishment of a citizen’s guard. But arms were not to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
be had. It was well known that there were large stores
of them somewhere in the city, but no one knew where to
find them. What is this? A rumor runs through the
crowd: “There are arms at the Hotel des Invalides;
muskets, thirty thousand and more;” and now the discordant
cries resolve into one long and steadfast shout,
“<i>Les Invalides! Les Invalides!</i>” and in the bright sunshine
of this July morning, upon the esplanade of the
Invalides, thirty thousand men stand grim and menacing.
But there is no resistance. The gates are thrown open
and the mob rush in. They find in the armory thirty
thousand muskets and six pieces of cannon; and now, as
by common instinct, resounds the cry, “<i>La Bastile! La
Bastile!</i>” The crowds across the Seine take up the
shout, while from the Champs Élysées, the Tuileries Gardens,
and the Palais Royal, comes back, as it were, the
echo, indistinct at first, but in ever-increasing volume,
“<i>La Bastile! La Bastile!</i>” as one hundred thousand
men, shouting, swearing, and brandishing their pikes and
guns, rush forward, a living torrent, to assail with these
feeble means, that fortress <i>par excellence</i> of France,—a
fortress which the army of Monsieur le Prince, le grand
Condé, had besieged in vain for three and twenty days.</p>

<p>Enormous, massive, blackened with age, the gloomy
emblem of royal prerogative, exciting by its mysterious
power and menace the terror and execration of every one
who passed beneath its shadow; its eight great towers
darkening the air in gloomy grandeur, the world-renowned
prison of the Bastile, the fortress <i>par excellence</i>, loomed
lofty at the entrance of Paris, in the very heart of the
Faubourg St. Antoine.</p>

<p>De Launey, the governor, from the summit of his towers
had, for many hours, heard the roar of the insurgent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
city; and now, as he saw the black mass of countless
thousands approaching, he turned pale and trembled. M.
Thuriot was sent by the electors of the Hotel de Ville to
summon the Bastile to surrender. The drawbridge was
lowered and he was admitted. De Launey received him
at the head of his staff. “I summon you,” said Thuriot,
“in the name of the people.” But De Launey, who was
every moment expecting the arrival of troops from Versailles,
refused to surrender the fortress, but added that
he would not fire upon the people if they did not fire upon
him. Thuriot, perceiving the cannon, and knowing that
the governor had received an order from the Hotel de
Ville to dismount them, exclaimed:—</p>

<p>“You have not had the cannon dismounted.”</p>

<p>“I have had them drawn in; that is all.”</p>

<p>“You will not have them dismounted, then?”</p>

<p>“No! the king’s cannon are here by the king’s order,
sir; they can only be dismounted by an order from the
king.”</p>

<p>“Monsieur De Launey,” said Thuriot, “the real king,
whom I counsel you to obey, is yonder”; and he showed
to the governor the vast crowd filling the square before
the fortress, and whose weapons glittered in the sunshine.</p>

<p>“Sir,” replied De Launey haughtily, “you may, perhaps
acknowledge two kings; but I, the governor of the
Bastile,—I know but <i>one</i>, and he is Louis XVI. who
has affixed his name to a commission by virtue of which I
command here both men and things”; and, stamping his
foot, he added angrily: “In the name of the king, sir,
leave this place at once.” Thuriot withdrew, but he had
hardly emerged from the massive portals and crossed the
drawbridge of the moat, which was immediately raised
behind him, ere the people commenced the attack. Uproar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
and confusion ensued. One hundred thousand men,
filling all the streets and alleys, all the windows and
house-tops of the adjacent buildings, opened upon the
Bastile an incessant fire, harmlessly flattening their bullets
against the massive stone walls. Priests, nobles,
wealthy citizens, ragged and emaciate mendicants, men,
women, boys, and girls, were mingled in the assault,
pressing side by side; apparently the whole of Paris,
with one united will, combined against the great bulwark
of tyranny. For five hours the attack continued; at five
in the afternoon, the French soldiers raised a flag of truce
upon the towers. This movement plunged De Launey
into despair. One hundred thousand men were beleaguering
his fortress. The troops from Versailles had not
arrived, and three-fourths of his garrison had already
abandoned him, and gone over to his assailants. Death
was his inevitable doom. Seizing a match he rushed
toward the magazine, determined to blow up the citadel.
There were one hundred and thirty-five barrels of gunpowder
in the vaults. Two subaltern officers crossed
their bayonets before him, and the lives of one hundred
thousand people were saved. Gradually the flag of truce
was seen through the smoke; the firing ceased, and the
cry resounded through the crowd, and was echoed along
the streets of Paris, “<i>La Bastile</i> surrenders!” “The
fortress which Louis XIV. and Turenne had pronounced
impregnable, surrendered not to the arms of its assailants,
for they had produced no impression upon it; it was conquered
by the public opinion which pervaded Paris, and
which vanquished its garrison.” While these scenes were
transpiring at Paris, Versailles was in excitement. Courier
after courier arrived, breathless, announcing that the
Bastile was taken, that the troops in Paris refused to fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
upon the crowd, that De Launey was slain, and that the
cavalry of Lambese were flying before the people.</p>

<p>No eye was closed at Versailles that night, unless, perchance,
it was that of the king, Louis XVI.; for all felt
the counter-shock of that terrible concussion with which
Paris was still trembling. The French guards, the bodyguards,
and the Swiss, drawn up in platoons and grouped
near the openings of all the principal streets, were conversing
among themselves, or with those of the citizens
whose fidelity to the monarchy inspired them with confidence;
for Versailles has at all times been a royalist city.
Religious respect for the monarchy and for the monarch
was ingrafted in the hearts of its inhabitants as if it were
a quality of its soil. Having always lived near kings,
fostered by their bounty, beneath the shade of their wonders,
having always inhaled the intoxicating perfume of
the <i>fleur-de-lys</i>, and seen the brilliant gold of the garments,
and the smiles upon the august lips of royalty,
the inhabitants of Versailles, for whom kings had built
a city of marble and porphyry, felt almost kings themselves;
and, even at the present day,—even now, when
the splendid palace of <i>Louis Quatorze</i> stands silent
in its grandeur; when no longer the marble court is
thronged with gorgeous equipages, and</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Up the chestnut alley, all in flower so white and pure,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Strut the red and yellow lacqueys of the Madame Pompadour;”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="unindent">when the vast gardens where once Louis, the <i>Grand
Monarque</i>, surrounded by his train of lords and ladies,
moved majestic, “monarch of all he surveyed and of all
who surveyed him,” are silent and deserted;—even now,
Versailles must either belie its origin, or, considering
itself as a fragment of the fallen monarchy, and no longer
feeling the pride of power and wealth, must at least retain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
the poetical associations of regret and the sovereign
charms of melancholy. By his answer to the Marquis de
Brézé, Mirabeau had struck the very face of royalty.</p>

<p>By the taking of the Bastile, the people had struck it
to the heart, paralyzed its nerves of action, and given it
a death-blow. “But the monarch of France, from his
palace at Versailles, heard the thunders of the distant
cannonade, and yet inscribed upon his puerile journal,
‘<i>Nothing!</i>’”</p>

<p>“Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad;”
and the adage applies fitly to the French court during the
six months preceding the overthrow. Never had the
nobles been so haughty and domineering. Never had
they looked upon the people with such supreme contempt.
Their arrogance passed all bounds. Even Marie Antoinette
exclaimed in terror, “This <i>noblesse</i> will ruin us!”</p>

<p>The Flanders regiment had been stationed at Versailles;
and on the 1st of October a banquet was given
to the officers at the palace. Wine was liberally supplied
from the royal cellars, and was so liberally partaken of
that the banquet became a scene of riot and disorder.
The revolutionary movement was cursed intensely, and
the national cockade trampled under foot. The tidings
of this <i>fête</i> spread rapidly through Paris, exciting great
indignation. The court was feasting; the people starving.
Versailles was filled with rejoicing; Paris with
mourning.</p>

<p>The morning of the 5th of October dawns dark, cold,
and dreary. The people of Paris are starving. About a
baker’s shop is a crowd of women and children, crying
for bread. Bread is not to be had. “<i>À Versailles,
bonnes femmes!</i>” cries a man passing by. “<i>À Versailles!</i>
there is bread enough there, and to spare. <i>À Versailles!</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
the land of plenty, feasting, and revelry! <i>À Versailles!</i>”
A young girl seizes a drum, and cries aloud, “Bread!
bread!”</p>

<p>Soon a mob is collected; three or four hundred women
presently increased to as many thousands. They follow
their leader, echoing her cry, “Bread! bread!” On to
the Hôtel de Ville they rush. But there is no bread
there; and their cry is now, “<i>À Versailles! À Versailles!</i>”
“We will give the men,” they exclaim, “a
lesson in courage. If they cannot support and protect
us, we will do it for ourselves.”</p>

<p>And so along beside the Tuileries, and through the
Elysian Fields, rushes on this mighty mass, headlong
towards Versailles. Couriers have been sent forward to
warn the king and queen of the approaching peril. His
Majesty, King Louis XVI., for want of something <i>better</i>
to do, has gone to chase hares at Meudon. He is sent
for, post haste, and returns to Versailles. “About
seven hundred gentlemen were then in the palace, all
in full dress, <i>chapeau sous le bras</i>, and armed only
with dress swords. Some few had found pistols; and
in that unmilitary fashion they declared themselves
determined to defend the château if attacked.”</p>

<p>Five minutes after the king’s return, the women arrived,
singing, “<i>Vive Henri IV.!</i>” and more like furies
than suppliants. All the shops were instantly closed;
drums beat to arms, the <i>tocsin</i> sounded, and the troops
were drawn up on the Place d’Armes. Entrance to the
courts of the palace was refused; but finally the women
sent a deputation of fifteen to the king. He received
them very graciously, and promised what they desired,
so that they came out of the palace shouting, “<i>Vive le
roi!</i>” and praising the goodness of the king to such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
extent that their fellow-Amazons, in rage, would have
strung them to the nearest lamp-posts had not the soldiers
interfered.</p>

<p>At nine o’clock, news was brought that General de Lafayette,
at the head of the National Guards and the
<i>Gardes Française</i>, and followed by a crowd of the
Parisian people, was on his way to Versailles. M. de
Saint-Priest immediately sought the king, and urged him
to leave the palace before their arrival. “The road is
open,” he said; “a picket of the household troops is at
the gate of the Orangery, and your Majesty, on horseback,
at the head of an escort, can freely pass whithersoever
you wish.”</p>

<p>Poor Louis! He would wait the course of events; not
from courage to face whatever might happen, but from
want of resolution to depart. Rightly had the queen
called him “<i>le pauvre homme</i>.” In this hour of menacing
danger she found no protector in her poor, miserably
weak husband and king. But she needed none; for
“she alone, among all women and all men, wore a face
of courage, of lofty calmness and resolve this day. She
alone saw clearly what she meant to do; and Theresa’s
daughter dares do what she means, were all France threatening
her: abide where her children are, where her husband
is.”</p>

<p>Near midnight Lafayette arrived at the château, pale
as death, wet through, and splashed with mud. He had
ridden hard and fast in advance of his troops, that he
might check any alarm felt by the royal family at the
sudden incursion of the mixed multitudes of National
Guards, <i>Gardes Française</i>, and volunteers of all sorts,
whom he had unwillingly been made to lead. Assuming
the guarding of the château, he prevailed upon the queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
and her ladies to retire to their apartments and seek
sleep without fear.</p>

<p>Gradually quiet was restored, and tired, tempest-tossed
Versailles lay down to rest. Alas, for peaceful dreams!
All know the story of that dreadful night. How the mob,
prowling round the palace, found a door unguarded; how
they rushed in, and, pressing blindly on, came to the
queen’s door; how they fought; how the good guard who
defended it poured out their life-blood upon the marble
floor; how the queen had barely time to escape through
the <i>Œil de Bœuf</i>, when the howling mob rushed in, and
stabbed her bed, again and again, with bloody pikes and
swords; and how at last the guards of Lafayette
arrived and drove them from the palace. It was a night
of horror. The queen was saved; but better for Marie
Antoinette would it have been, if in that short agony she
could have died. It was not to be. A mysterious Providence
reserved her, after years of unutterable suffering,
for a death more awful.</p>

<p>The morning of the 6th was now dawning, and the
whole multitude, swarming around the palace, demanded
as with one voice that the king should go to Paris. As
he could not very well do otherwise, the king decided to
comply. Loud shouts now rose of “<i>Vive le roi!</i>” But
threatening voices were raised against the queen; “<i>À
bas l’Autrichienne!</i>” “<i>À bas l’Autrichienne!</i>” they cried.</p>

<p>“Madame,” said Lafayette, “the king goes to Paris;
what will you do?”</p>

<p>“Accompany the king,” replied Marie Antoinette.</p>

<p>“Come with me, then,” rejoined the general. He led
the queen upon the balcony, from whence she looked upon
the multitude, agitated like the ocean in a storm. Proudly
she stood, a true daughter of her imperial mother, Maria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
Theresa, and calmly she gazed upon the mighty throng.
The murmurs of the crowd were hushed. At the sight of
this fearless woman standing thus exposed to all their
fury, those who would have torn in pieces the daughter of
the Cæsars were compelled to render homage. Lafayette,
bending, took her hand and kissed it, while the marble
court resounded with the shouts of “<i>Vive la reine!</i>”</p>

<p>A little after noon the royal family entered their carriage,
and slowly the melancholy <i>cortège</i> set out for
Paris.</p>

<p>As they passed through the gates of Versailles, the
queen glanced backward for a moment upon that splendid
palace, the scene of so much happiness and grandeur,
which she was to see no more. And the carriage rolled
on, bearing its occupants to a dungeon and the scaffold.
Adieu to Versailles! Royalty was vanquished; and
Louis XVI. and Marie Antoinette at the Tuileries were
but the captive slaves of their subjects.</p>

<p>Months rolled by, months of insult and humiliation,
until even the king was aroused, and seriously contemplated
flight; that, escaping from the scenes of violence
and danger to which he was exposed in Paris, he might
draw around him his loyal subjects upon the frontiers of
France, and there endeavor amicably to adjust the difficulties
which desolated the kingdom.</p>

<p>Gabriel Honoré de Mirabeau, the son of thunder, was
the mightiest and most terrible product of the Revolution.
He was the ugliest man and the grandest orator in chaotic
France. He swayed the multitude; and it seemed, as
he himself believed, that if he would, he, and he only,
might yet save the monarchy.</p>

<p>It was at St. Cloud that Marie Antoinette held her
famous interview with Mirabeau. As she felt the spell of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
his genius, so he rendered homage to her majesty. The
interview lasted an hour, and Mirabeau closed it with the
words: “Madame, when the empress, your mother,
admitted one of her subjects to the honor of her presence,
she did not take leave of him without allowing him to
kiss her hand.” Marie Antoinette held out her hand.
“Madame,” exclaimed Mirabeau, “the monarchy is
saved!” But opportunity was not given him to keep or
break his pledge. Under the sweet April sunshine of 1791,
Mirabeau breathed his last. His death paralyzed the hopes
of the king, and he now resolved to spare no endeavors
to secure his escape; and so in the darkness of midnight,
on the 20th of June, 1791, the king, the queen, Madame
Elizabeth, the two royal children, and Madame Tourzel,
their governess, escaped silently from the palace of
Tuileries, and entering their carriages, which stood ready,
drove rapidly away. Alas for fond hopes! Through
the king’s want of caution, the royal family were recognized
at Varennes, arrested, and brought back to Paris.
Ah, the humiliations of that long and weary, crowd-encompassed,
dust-enveloped journey back to Paris!
Threats, imprecations, and torrents of abuse were hurled
upon the royal family from all sides. More than this they
could not do, for a forest of glittering bayonets surrounded
the royal carriage. It was by the glaring light of the torches
that the sorrowful <i>cortège</i> entered Paris, and under a canopy
of glistening steel the royal family ascended once more
the marble staircase of the Tuileries Palace.</p>

<p>A year has rolled away. The 20th of June, 1792, has
passed,—that day of horrors on which the mob, with
shouts of “<i>Vive la nation!</i>” broke into and rushed
through the palace of the Tuileries; that day on which
the queen was exposed for hours to insults, abuses, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
derisive jests; that day on which the king was made to
place upon his royal brow the red cap of the Jacobins,
while the mob, exulting in their victory, cried loudly:
“<i>Vive le roi!</i>” Poor Louis! As he entered the apartment
of the queen, after the rabble had been cleared from the
palace, he saw, in the reflection of a mirror, the <i>bonnet
rouge</i> upon his head, and flinging it upon the ground, he
turned to the queen, exclaiming, with a burst of tears:
“Ah! madame, it was not to see me thus insulted that I
brought you from Vienna.”</p>

<p>How different were the days when the boy and girl met
on that bright spring morning at Compiègne, and hunted,
danced, quarrelled, and kissed again, in the old, luxurious
times at Versailles and Marly, Fontainebleau and Choisy-le-Roi!</p>

<p>The 10th of August has arrived. The streets are
swarming with a frenzied multitude. All Paris is marching
toward the Tuileries, for the mob have declared that
unless the dethronement of the king is procured, they will
sack the palace. The peal of bells, the clangor of drums,
the rumbling of artillery wheels, and the shouts of the
advancing bands fill the air.</p>

<p>From every direction, east, west, north and south, the
portentous booming of the <i>tocsin</i> is heard, and the infuriated
insurgents, in numbers which cannot be counted,
through all the streets and avenues are pouring toward
the palace.</p>

<p>The spectacle aroused the energies of Marie Antoinette,
and as she entered the apartment where her “<i>pauvre
homme</i>” stood bewildered and submissive to his lot, she
approached a grenadier, and drawing a pistol from his
belt, presented it to the king, exclaiming, “Now, sire,
now is the time to show yourself a <i>king!</i>”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>

<p>But there was nothing imperial in the nature of Louis
XVI. With a passive meekness, which it is difficult to
understand, he took the pistol and quietly handed it back
to the grenadier.</p>

<p>It was five o’clock of one of the most brilliant of summer
mornings as the king, followed by the queen, and accompanied
by six staff officers, descended the marble
stairs and entered the courtyard to review the troops and
ascertain the spirit with which they were animated. The
music of martial bands greeted him, the polished weapons
of the soldiers glittered in the sun as they presented arms,
and a few voices rather languidly shouted: “<i>Vive le roi!</i>”
Others, however, shouted defiantly: “<i>Vive la nation!</i>”
thus showing that many of those who were marshalled
for his defence were ready to unite with his assailants.
Had the king been a spirited man, in uniform, mounted on
horseback, he would have roused their enthusiasm, for the
French have always loved the <i>vrai chevalier</i>. But fat,
awkward Louis was well calculated to excite no other emotion
than that of compassion blended with contempt.</p>

<p>“The appearance of the queen in this terrible hour
riveted every eye, and excited even the enthusiasm of
her foes. Her flushed cheek, dilated nostril, compressed
lip, and flashing eye invested her with an imperial beauty
almost more than human. Her head was erect, her carriage
proud, her step dignified, and she looked around her
upon applauding friends and assailing foes with a majesty
of courage which touched every heart. Even the most
ardent patriots forgot, for the moment, their devotion to
liberty, in the enthusiasm excited by the heroism of the
queen.”</p>

<p>On entering the palace Marie Antoinette exclaimed in
despair, “All is lost! The king has shown no energy.
A review like this has done us more harm than good.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>

<p>The king had now passed into the garden to ascertain
the disposition of the troops stationed there. With his
small retinue he traversed the whole length of the line.
Some of the battalions received him with applause, others
were silent, while here and there voices, in continually
increasing numbers, cried, “<i>À bas le veto! à bas le
tyran!</i>” As the king turned to retrace his steps, menaces
and insults were multiplied. Some of the gunners
even left their places and thrust their fists in his face,
assailing him with the most brutal abuse. The clamor
penetrated to the interior of the palace, and the queen,
turning pale as death, sank into a chair, exclaiming,
“Great God! they are hooting the king. We are all
lost.” The king returned to the palace, pale, exhausted,
perspiring at every pore, and overwhelmed with shame
and confusion. He retired to his cabinet. M. Roederer,
chief magistrate of the Department of the Seine, entered
immediately.</p>

<p>“Sire,” said he, “you have not a moment to lose.
Neither the number nor the disposition of the men here
assembled can guarantee your life nor the lives of your
family. There is no safety for you but in the National
Assembly.” Such a refuge to the high-spirited queen
was more dreadful than death. It was draining the cup
of humiliation to the dregs.</p>

<p>“Go to the Assembly!” exclaimed Marie Antoinette;
“never! never will I take refuge there. Rather than
submit to such infamy, I would prefer to be nailed to the
walls of the palace.”</p>

<p>“It is there only,” replied M. Roederer, “that the
royal family can be in safety, and it is necessary to
escape immediately. In another quarter of an hour,
perhaps, I shall not be able to command a retreat.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>“What!” rejoined the queen, “have we then no defenders?
Are we alone?”</p>

<p>“Yes, madam,” M. Roederer replied, “we are alone.
The troops in the garden and in the court are fraternizing
with your assailants, and turning their guns against the
palace. All Paris is on the march. Action is useless;
resistance impossible.”</p>

<p>A gentleman present, who had been active in promoting
reform, ventured to add his voice in favor of an
immediate retreat to the Assembly. The queen turned
upon him sternly, exclaiming: “Silence, sir, silence! It
becomes <i>you</i> to be silent here. When the mischief is
done, those who did it should not pretend to wish to remedy
it.”</p>

<p>M. Roederer resumed, saying: “Madam, you endanger
the lives of your husband and your children. Think of
the responsibility which you take upon yourself!” The
queen cast a glance upon her daughter, and a mother’s
fears prevailed. The crimson blood mounted to her temples.
Rising from her seat, she said proudly, “Let
us go.”</p>

<p>A guard of soldiers was instantly called in, and the
royal family descended the stairs, entered the garden, and
crossed it unopposed. The leaves of autumn strewed the
paths, and the young Dauphin kicked them before him as
he walked along. It is characteristic of the weak mental
qualities of the king, that in such an hour he should have
remarked, “There are a great many leaves. They fall
early this year.” Some writers have found in this expression
the evidence of a deep and solemn mind <i>reflecting</i>
upon the calamities which had fallen upon France.
Reflections! What had Louis XVI. to do with <i>reflections</i>
at a time like this? His affairs demanded <i>actions</i>, not
<i>reflections</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>At the hall of the Assembly they found an immense
crowd blocking up the entrance. “They shall not enter
here,” was the cry; “they shall no longer deceive the
nation. They are the cause of all our misfortunes. <i>À
bas le veto! à bas l’Autrichienne! Abdication ou mort!</i>”
But the soldiers forced their way through, and the royal
family entered the Assembly. The king approached the
president. “I have come hither,” he said, “to prevent
a great crime. I thought I could not be safer than with
you.”</p>

<p>“You may rely, sire,” the president replied, “on the
firmness of the Assembly.”</p>

<p>But few of the excited thousands who crowded all the
approaches to the Tuileries were conscious that the royal
family had escaped from the palace. The clamor rapidly
increased to a scene of terrific uproar. The volleys of
musketry, the deep booming of artillery, the cries of fury,
and the shrieks of the wounded and dying filled the air.</p>

<p>The hall of the Assembly was already crowded to suffocation,
and the deputies stood powerless and appalled,
for all now felt that a storm was beating against the
throne which no human power could allay. Suddenly the
king beckoned to an attendant, and spoke a few words to
him in an undertone. The man started to leave the hall,
but the terror-stricken deputies crowded around him.</p>

<p>“What has the king said?” they anxiously inquired;
“what new order has he given? Quick! quick! speak
out!”</p>

<p>“Why! my friends,” replied the messenger, laughing,
“do you not know that you are dealing with a Bourbon?
The king has simply <i>ordered his dinner</i>.”</p>

<p>And so in the midst of the National Assembly, while
outside a raging, howling mob was storming his palace of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
the Tuileries, and his good Swiss guard were pouring out
their life-blood upon the marble stairs, and while the
throne of his ancestors hung tottering in the balance,
King Louis munched his bread and drank his wine.
Thus low had fallen the descendant of the <i>Grand Monarque</i>.</p>

<p>The king munched on; the mob took and sacked the
palace; thousands lay dead in the Place du Carrousel,
around the Tuileries, and in the Champs Élysées. The
throne was demolished, and the last vestiges of the old
court <i>régime</i> and the monarchy of the superb <i>Louis
Quatorze</i> disappeared forever.</p>

<p>And now followed those long months of imprisonment
in the Temple,—months of unutterable suffering, while
the king was on trial for his life. And then that sorrowful
night of the 20th of January, when for the last time
the king was permitted to behold his family. Ah! what
prayers, what groans, what tears were heard and seen
that night. Then came that awful morning of the 21st
of January, 1793, and while the king was suffering upon
the guillotine, the queen, with Madame Elizabeth and the
children, remained in their prison, in the endurance of
anguish as severe as could be laid on human hearts. As
the deep booming of the artillery announced that the
fatal axe had fallen, poor Marie Antoinette swooned
dead away.</p>

<p>But haste we on to the last act of the dreadful tragedy.</p>

<p>On the 2d of August, 1793, Marie Antoinette Jeanne
Josèphe de Lorraine, Queen of France and Navarre
and Archduchess of Austria, the once brilliant sovereign
of Versailles, now a prisoner and a widow, torn from her
children and treated like a common felon, was removed
from the prison of the Temple to that of the Conciergerie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
there to linger until her release from human barbarity on
the 16th of October. In one of the vast halls of this edifice,
when occupied by the Parliament, Louis XIV. had
entered during a sitting, booted and spurred, and declared
that he was the state. “It was a strange fate that this
building, once the dwelling-place of the sovereigns of the
House of Capet, when holding their state in the capital,
should see a captive within its walls, the widow of their
descendant,—the ‘widow Capet,’ as the Jacobins described
her in their blood-stained edicts.” The damp,
foul dungeons were the most gloomy tombs imagination
can conceive. Down the dripping and slimy steps the
queen was led by the light of a tallow candle, until,
through a labyrinth of corridors, she approached her iron
door. The rusty hinges grated as the door was opened,
and entering, she struck her forehead against the low beam.</p>

<p>“Did you hurt yourself?” inquired the <i>gendarme</i>.</p>

<p>“No, nothing can further harm me.” Poor Marie
Antoinette!</p>

<p>“The candle gave just light enough to reveal the
horrors of her cell. The floor was covered with mud, and
streams of water trickled down the stone walls. A miserable
pallet, with a dirty covering of coarse and tattered
cloth, a small pine table, and a chair, constituted the only
furniture.” So deep was the fall from the <i>salons</i> of Versailles!</p>

<p>Here for two long, weary months the poor queen lingered;
her misery being slightly alleviated by the kind-heartedness
of Madame Richard, the wife of the jailer,
and Rosalie Lamorlière, an inmate of the prison, who did
all the rigorous rules allowed them to mitigate her woes.
“The night of her arrival at the Conciergerie the queen
had not so much as a change of linen. For days she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
begged to be allowed some, but it was not till the tenth
day that her prayer was granted, when Michonis went to
the Temple and brought back with him a parcel of linen
and some clothes; among others, the white gown which
the queen wore on the day of her execution. Little by
little everything was taken from the queen. The souvenirs
of her happy past, to which she clung, were taken
from her; first her watch, a gift of her mother’s, and
which had never left her since she left Vienna,—the
watch which had counted the happy hours of her youth
and womanhood was taken from her. Bitterly she wept
at having to part with it, as if it had been a friend.
There was not a moment that the queen could be out of
sight of her <i>gens d’armes;</i> a little screen, four feet high,
was the only separation between the space in which she
changed her dress and those men.” Imagine the misery
of this state for a woman so delicately nurtured, so luxuriously
brought up, having at her command a household
of over four hundred persons, and accustomed to the refinements
of the most polished court in Europe.</p>

<p>In the old days of splendor at Versailles, when her attendants
were unable to find some article of dress or
toilet, she had exclaimed pettishly: “How <i>terrible</i> it is
not to be able to find what one wants!” But now, in
these last days of her life, when surrounded by every
aggravation that could wound a proud spirit, treated like
the worst of offenders, insulted as mother, wife, queen,
and woman, she never uttered one word that could be
construed into petulance, or gave one angry look.</p>

<p>“With threads taken from her bedding, she worked a
kind of garter, and not being allowed any knitting-needles,
used a pair of toothpicks. When finished, she dropped
it, with a significant look, when her jailer entered the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
prison. It reached—thanks to one of her loyalest followers,
M. Hue, a faithful servant of Louis XVI.—its
destination, for he gave it to Madame Royale when he
accompanied her, two years later, to Vienna.” This was
the richest legacy the daughter of Maria Theresa and the
queen of France could bequeath to her child. The queen
was not so fortunate with another little relic that she
hoped her daughter would receive. This consisted of a
pair of gloves and a lock of her hair, which she slipped
into the jailer’s hand; but the action was observed by
one of the <i>gens d’armes</i>, and the little parcel was confiscated.
“The damp of the queen’s underground prison
was such that her black gown began to fall into rags.
She had another,—a white one; but this she wore only on
the day of her death.</p>

<p>“The few other clothes she had were in a deplorable
state, and required constant repair. She was only permitted
three shirts, but the revolutionary tribunal decided
that but one of these should be given to the queen,
and worn ten days before another was allowed her; even
her handkerchiefs were only allowed one by one, and a
strict account was kept of every article as it came from
or entered her prison.” Not being allowed a chest of
drawers she placed her clothes in a paper box that Rosalie
brought her, “and which she received,” says Rosalie,
“as if it had been the most beautiful piece of furniture in
the world.” Rosalie also procured her a little looking-glass,
bordered with red, with little Chinese figures
painted on the sides. This too seemed much to please
the queen; and doubtless it gave her more satisfaction
than had done all the miles of gorgeous, gilded mirrors at
Versailles.</p>

<p>And now the 14th of October has come, and Marie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
Antoinette is summoned to appear before her judges.
There are wretches present who cry as she enters, “<i>À
bas l’Autrichienne!</i>” Yet even the fear of the guillotine
is not able to check the visible signs of pity and deep-felt
sympathy her appearance elicits in others.</p>

<p>How startlingly the sorrowful present contrasts with
the gay and brilliant past, when, in her bridal dress of
satin, pearls, and diamonds, the Duc de Cossé-Brissac led
her to the balcony of the Tuileries to gratify the eager
desire of the dense multitude to see her, and bade her
behold in them two hundred thousand adorers, while
shouts of “<i>Vive la Dauphine!</i>” rent the air. Marie
Antoinette was then a youthful bride. Twenty-three
years have passed away, and she is now a widow. In a
faded black dress, she stands in the theatre of that same
palace of the Tuileries, amidst a throng of <i>canaille</i>, to be
tried for her life by men whose own lives would be the
forfeit, if either compassion or justice should move them
to find her innocent. Alas! the daughter of the Cæsars,
she whom Edmund Burke had seen, “glittering like the
morning star, full of life, and splendor, and joy,” is
hurled low indeed. And yet, to me, as she stands there
in her frayed and patched black gown, with her widow’s
cap upon her almost white hair, before her judges, and
her jury, and the crowded tribunes, Marie Antoinette is
a far nobler, far grander figure, than when a blooming
bride she stood upon the Tuileries balcony, surrounded by
the acclamations of the multitude, or when, as queen of
France, blazing with diamonds, and in all the pomp and
splendor of regality, she received the homage of her
courtiers in the gilded galleries of Versailles.</p>

<p>The tribunal which judged the queen was composed of
a president and four judges, the public prosecutor, Fouquier-Tinville,—a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
man who even at that time was notorious
as being amongst the most inhuman of the monsters
who then governed revolutionary France,—the chief
registrar, and fifteen jurymen. Fouquier-Tinville had
himself drawn out at great length the act of accusation.
He looked upon it as his <i>chef d’œuvre</i>, and Chauveau-Lagarde,
the queen’s counsel, did not exaggerate when he
called it a “work of the devil.” In it the queen was compared
to Messalina, Brunehild, Frédégond, and the
Medici. He declared that “since her arrival in France
she had been the curse and leech of the French nation;
that she had maintained a secret correspondence with the
king of Bohemia and Hungary; that her aim was the
ruin of the country; that by her instigation, and in concert
with the brothers of Louis XVI. and the infamous
Calonne, formerly minister of finance, she had lavished
the wealth of the nation, the spoils of the sweat of the
people, in maintaining her criminal expenditure and in
paying the agents of her treasonable intrigues; that she
had sent millions out of the country to the emperor, in
order to maintain the war against the republic, and that
she had thus exhausted the revenues of the country.
Further, that since the commencement of the Revolution
she had not ceased an instant from maintaining a treasonable
correspondence with the enemy, and, by every
means in her power, aided and abetted a counter revolution.”
He then went back and harped, at great length,
upon the affair of the Gardes du Corps at Versailles in
1789, and also on the flight to Varennes; accused her of
the loss of life on the 17th of July, 1792, at the <i>Champs
de Mars</i>, and declared that owing to her, and her alone,
the massacre occurred at Nancy and elsewhere. “Thus
this man raved on in an endless series of accusations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
which seem more as if they came from the disordered
brain of a homicidal maniac than from a man in his
senses.”</p>

<p>Indeed, one can only believe that some of the writings
and actions of the actors in the year of terror, 1793,
were owing to a state of madness. It is said, and on
good authority, that Fouquier-Tinville ultimately confessed
to being pursued by horrible visions, saying that
he saw the spirits of those he had condemned to death
menacing him, not in his dreams, like Richard III., but
in broad daylight. And well he might; for between the
10th of March, 1793, and the 27th of July of the following
year, two thousand six hundred and sixty-nine victims
were sent from that tribunal to the guillotine.</p>

<p>Then followed the second day. “What is your name?”
inquired one of the judges.</p>

<p>“Marie Antoinette de Lorraine d’Autriche,” answered
the queen.</p>

<p>“What is your condition?” was the next question.</p>

<p>“Widow of Louis, king of France.”</p>

<p>“What is your age?”</p>

<p>“Thirty-eight.”</p>

<p>The act of accusation was then read, and the witnesses
appeared. Of these there were forty-one,—men of all
sorts and conditions of life, and who were ready to swear
anything, however improbable, however atrocious, against
the queen. All through the long hours of that awful day
the different witnesses were questioned and cross-questioned.
She saw again faces familiar to her in past
years, faces that must have recalled Versailles and the
Trianon; and with what feelings of horror must she have
recognized Simon, her son’s jailer and persecutor, among
that crowd of witnesses! When the charges relative to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
the queen’s treatment of her son were again alluded to,
the queen deigned no reply. Seeing this, one of the
jurors called the attention of the president to her silence.
One can imagine what a hush must at that moment have
fallen on that great crowd, eager to hear what the queen
would answer to such an infamy. But Marie Antoinette
was equal, aye, more than equal, to the occasion. She
rose proudly from her chair, and in a majestic voice
exclaimed: “If I have not answered, it is because nature
herself refuses to answer such an accusation made to a
mother. I appeal to all that may be present.”</p>

<p>“A thrill ran through that vast hall—a thrill that has
not ceased to be felt by all who can enter into what the
feelings of that mother were at such a moment. No wonder
that when Robespierre heard what a sensation had
been made by the sublime manner in which the queen had
met that charge, and the effect it had upon the audience,
he, being then at dinner, should have broken his plate
with rage, and cursed the folly of Fouquier-Tinville in
preferring it.” At last all was over, and the queen was
asked if she had anything to say. “I was a queen, and
you took away my crown; a wife, and you killed my
husband; a mother, and you deprived me of my children.
My blood alone remains. Take it, but do not make me
suffer long.” Then in the dignity of silence, and without
the moving of a muscle, she listened to the sentence condemning
her to die. It was ten minutes past four in the
morning of the 16th of October. The queen had, with
hardly an interval, endured this trial more than twenty
hours. “Rising from her seat, she walked away calmly
and serenely, leaving her judges, or rather murderers,
without one look of reproach or shade of anger. But on
nearing the portion of the hall where, beyond the barriers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
the mob was collected, she raised somewhat her noble
head. A great French painter has left a picture of this
scene. The queen faces the spectator, as she walks along
the side of the barriers, above which the crowd are eagerly
scanning her; behind follow the <i>gens d’armes</i> with shouldered
muskets; beyond, under the dim light of a lamp,
appear the faces of the judges, a lurid background.
Delaroche has introduced the thin, handsome face of a
youth who seems to feel the iniquity of the transaction
keenly: we recognize the features of Bonaparte. Next
to the almost angelic sublimity of the figure of the queen,
the most touching thing in the picture is the face of a
young girl, who gazes, with a look of ineffable pity,
through her tears, at the queen as she walks by.”</p>

<p>Truly writes Sainte-Beuve. “I do not believe,” he
says, “that a monument of more atrocious stupidity, of
greater ignominy for our species, can exist, than this trial
of Marie Antoinette. When one reflects that a century
which considered itself enlightened and of the most refined
civilization, ends with public acts of such barbarity, one
begins to doubt of human nature itself, and to fear that
the brute, which is always in human nature, has the
ascendency.”</p>

<p>All Paris was under arms on this morning of the 16th
of October. The roll of the drum was heard through all
the sections; thirty thousand troops lined the streets
along which lay the route of the queen’s passage. The
bridges were guarded with cannon, by which stood the
gunners with lighted matches. Artillery was placed also
upon the squares and points of junction. At ten o’clock
no carriage was allowed in any of the streets that lie
between the Conciergerie and the Place de la Revolution.
All Paris was patrolled, and all this martial pomp, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
sounds as though the army of the enemy were at the very
gates of Paris, had been brought out to see a woman die!</p>

<p>Before the Conciergerie, before those beautiful iron
gates on which the royal arms of France and the golden
lilies are conspicuous, the crowd was thickest; every window
had its groups of spectators, every housetop had its
crowd of people.</p>

<p>There stands the wretched open cart, with its single
horse, its plank the only seat. There is a stir among the
crowd, and the queen ascends the prison steps. On seeing
the cart, she makes an involuntary pause. It is but an
instant. Then, with proud step and undaunted mien,
Marie Antoinette advances. A moment more, and she is
sealed in the cart. Sanson takes his place behind her.</p>

<p>Both he and his assistant have their three-cornered
hats under their arms. “On that occasion the only people
who behaved with decency were the executioners.”</p>

<p>Slowly the cart winds its way through the Rue Saint-Honoré.
The rabble yell, shout, and mouth at her, while
for the last time falls on her ear that hateful cry, “<i>À
bas l’Autrichienne! à bas l’Autrichienne!</i>”</p>

<p>Yet as much a queen is she,—this silent white-robed
figure, so simple, yet so grand in its forlornness,—as
when in her gilded coach, surrounded by a brilliant body-guard
of cavalry, she swept through the Avenue des
Champs Élysées, to the echoing shouts of “<i>Vive la
reine!</i>”</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“You all know the Place de la Concorde,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">’Tis hard by the Tuileries’ wall.</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">’Mid terraces, fountains, and statues,</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">There rises an obelisk tall.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ah! what a sight was this mighty Place de la Concorde,
then the Place de la Revolution, on that bright October<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
morning, filled with a vast and silent throng, while
the splendid palace and gardens of the Tuileries, where
so often the queen had been hailed with acclamations,
the spacious Elysian Fields, the pride of Paris, were all
spread around, as if in mockery of the sacrifice which was
there to be offered; and in the centre, sublime in its terrific
grandeur, towered the blood-red posts of the guillotine.
Slowly the cart made its way between the noble buildings
of the “<i>Garde Meuble</i>” and the Admiralty, and finally
reached the foot of the scaffold.</p>

<p>As the queen mounted the slippery steps, she trod upon
the foot of the executioner. “Pardon me,” said Marie
Antoinette, with as much courtesy as if she were addressing
a <i>grand seigneur</i> in the palace of Versailles. Kneeling,
she uttered a brief prayer, and then turning her eyes
to the distant towers of the Temple, exclaimed, “Adieu,
my children; I go to rejoin your father.”</p>

<p>She was bound to the plank. The gleaming axe slid
through the groove, and the long and dreadful tragedy of
the life of Marie Antoinette was closed.</p>

<p>That night, upon the records of the cemetery of the
Madeline, was made this entry:—</p>

<p>“<i>For the coffin of the Widow Capet,—six livres</i>.”</p>

<p>“The Revolution,” says De Tocqueville, “will ever
remain in darkness to those who do not look beyond it.
It can only be comprehended by the light of the ages
which preceded it. Without a clear view of society in the
olden time, of its laws, its faults, its prejudices, its sufferings,
and its greatness, it is impossible to understand
the conduct of the French during the sixty years which
have followed its fall.”</p>

<p>If absolute power could ever be fitly confided to mortal
man, where could nobler depositaries of that high trust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
have been found than in the succession of great men who
fill up the interval in the history of France from the accession
of Henry IV. to the death of Louis XIV.?</p>

<p>“What ruler of mankind was ever gifted with a spirit
more genial, or with views more comprehensive, than
those of Henry IV.? or with an integrity and a patriotism
more noble than that of Sully? or with an energy of will
superior to that of Richelieu? or with subtlety more profound
than that of Mazarin? or with a zeal and activity
surpassing that of Colbert? or with greater decision of
character than Louvois? or with a majesty transcending
that of Louis XIV?” And yet, what were the results of
so much genius and intellectual power when intrusted with
political powers so vast and unrestricted? The favorable
results were to add to the greatness of France, and to
give birth to some undying traditions, pointing to her
still more extensive aggrandizement. The unfavorable
results were to produce every possible variety of internal
and external misgovernment; to promote wars more sanguinary
than had ever before been waged between Christian
nations; to produce a waste of treasure so vast, that
the simple truth seems fabulous; to kindle persecutions
which altogether eclipse, in their enormity, those to which
the early Christians were subjected by the emperors of
Rome; and to corrupt the moral sense of the people by an
exhibition, at the court of their sovereigns, of a profligacy
of manners better befitting a prince of the barbarians
than a king of France.</p>

<p>According to the doctrine of M. Thomas, there is a
general law which regulates the progress of political
society. “Emerging from chaos, where its elements
battle with each other in wild confusion, it makes a
steadfast, though it may be a tardy, progress toward that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
perfect symmetry and order in which its ultimate perfection
consists.”</p>

<p>Thus the anarchy of the tenth and eleventh centuries
was the chaotic period of France. Out of that abyss first
rose the feudal oligarchy,—a state of orderly disorder.
Then succeeded the Capetian despotism, destined to
crush, one by one, the countless feudal privileges,
whether legislative, administrative, or judicial. When
the iron grasp of “royalty” had subdued and conquered
them all, then “royalty,” in the midst of the triumphs
she had won, presented herself to the nation in the person
of Louis XIV., the king <i>par excellence</i>, the <i>one</i> gigantic
privilege, the conqueror and survivor of all the rest.
This was the golden age of kings. The crown was everything;
the people, nothing. Robbed under the name of
custom and of law, the peasants toiled joylessly from the
cradle to the grave. Their sons were sent to strew
Europe with their bodies, in wars undertaken at the nod
of a courtesan. Their wives and daughters were torn
from them; and for the purpose of supporting lascivious,
and riotous splendor, of building <i>Parcs aux Cerfs</i>, of
pensioning discarded favorites, and of enriching corrupt
minions of every stamp, they were taxed,—so taxed that
the light and air of heaven hardly came to them free; and,
sunk in the dregs of indigence, a short crop compelled
them to live on food that the hounds of their taskmasters
would reject; and, finally, when in their agony they asked
some mitigation of their hard fate, they were answered
by the bayonets of foreign mercenaries.</p>

<p>“And a people,—stout manhood, gentle womanhood,
gray-haired age, and tender infancy, might turn their pale
faces upward and shriek for food, while fierce, licentious
nobles would scornfully bid them eat grass.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span></p>

<p>Such was the condition of the greater part of the French
people during the reign of that vilest of monarchs, King
Louis XV.</p>

<p>“Royalty” had sinned right royally. Right royally
must “royalty” atone for it. And the guillotine upon
the Place de la Concorde was but the expiation of St.
Bartholomew, of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes,
and of the <i>Parc aux Cerfs</i>.</p>

<p>And though we know that a people, crushed and downtrodden,
are striving to free themselves from lawless
oppression, we cannot but sympathize with Marie Antoinette,
through no fault of her own made queen of
France, to reap the whirlwind of wicked deeds sown by
her husband’s royal ancestors.</p>

<p>Frederick the Great, amid the battle-smoke at Sohr, or
Napoleon, upon the ensanguined field of Waterloo, never
struggled harder in support of their respective causes,
than did she, in the <i>salons</i> of Versailles and the Tuileries,
to sustain the falling monarchy.</p>

<p>“And when, at last, the long conflict was terminated,
and her combined enemies were victorious, when bereft
of her throne, of her husband, of her children, and of her
liberty, she was a prisoner in the hands of those whose
unalterable object was her destruction, she bore her accumulated
miseries with a serene resignation, an intrepid
fortitude, a true heroism of soul, of which the history of
the world does not afford a brighter example.”</p>

<p>In the royal burying-vault of the Bourbons, at the
Cathedral of St. Denis, now rest the remains of her,—once
the pride and joy of France,—the beautiful, unfortunate
Queen Marie Antoinette.</p>

<p>Grandeur, triumphs, sorrows, all are over.</p>

<h2>THE EMPRESS JOSEPHINE.<br>

<small>A.D. 1763-1814.</small></h2>

<div class="center">
<small>“Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown.”—<span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span>.</small><br>
<br>


<small>“Farewell, a long farewell, to all my greatness.”—<span class="smcap">Shakespeare</span>.</small><br>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">STRANGER than fiction are the facts of history; and
nowhere, among the imaginary characters of romance
and poetry, can be found a story of a life more marvellously
varied in experience, more weirdly strange in its
many thrilling scenes of unutterable misery or dazzlingly
triumphant splendor, than the history of the Empress
Josephine affords.</p>

<p>But remarkable as were the events of her life, her character
was still more remarkable. With no early advantages
of education, outside of the fashionable accomplishments
of music, drawing, and dancing; by her self-taught
acquirements, and diligent study, together with an intuitive
perception and aptitude, which enabled her mind to
grasp the gravest questions, she was in after-life a most
brilliant conversationalist; and by her comprehensive
genius and marvellous political foresight, she became the
safest, wisest, and most far-seeing of all Napoleon’s
advisers and counsellors. When influenced by her persuasive
voice, prompted by a heart incapable of any motive
but that of the sternest rectitude, and most exalted and
unselfish devotion, Napoleon’s acts were always to be
commended; and so highly did he prize her counsel, that
he called her his “Mentor.”</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 432px;">

<div class="caption">JOSÉPHINE.</div>
<div class="attrib2">EMPRESS OF FRANCE.</div>
</div>

<p>Never did she advise him to a false step; and history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
has shown that, regarding those plans and deeds of
Napoleon, which results have proved to have been unwise
or grievous mistakes, the gentle voice of Josephine had
never failed to give prophetic warning.</p>

<p>As Napoleon stands forth pre-eminent amongst the
famous men of history, so does the name of Josephine
shine with undying lustre among those of the most celebrated
heroines of the world. We are dazzled by her
gorgeous state and magnificence as empress. We admire
her keen intellect and exquisite tact, which never
failed to suggest the most perfect and pleasing demeanor,
under every emergency, in a time of many unsettled
political opinions and tottering thrones. But we love the
gentle, unselfish <i>woman</i>, whose heart ever responded to
every call for sympathy; whose hand was ever open to
bestow benefits; and whose marvellous heroism could
support her in the midst of such terrible reverses and
peculiar trials as only a woman’s heart could suffer, and
only a woman’s love could endure.</p>

<p>In writing the history of Josephine, we are forced to
look upon the darker side of Napoleon’s character. From
the time he ceased to heed her loving voice,—the persuasive
sweetness of which, he himself acknowledged; declaring,
“that the first applause of the French people
sounded to my ear sweet as the voice of Josephine,”—from
that time, the hitherto invincible Napoleon made one
false step after another, allowing himself to be influenced
by ambitious flatterers and deceived by evil counsellors;
following the <i>ignis fatuus</i> of an overweening ambition
and thirst for power, which had taken the place of the
noble spirit of aspiring to the uplifting of his countrymen
and defending the sacred rights of the people, which
had actuated his former deeds, and covered his name with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
the splendid glory and well-deserved honor which he had
before achieved.</p>

<p>But now even his transcendent genius and glorious
deeds of valor are to be tarnished by grievous mistakes,
and even crime.</p>

<p>The first false step taken, his downfall was as terrible
and rapid as his uprising had been sudden and glorious.</p>

<p>Already evil counsellors are whispering in his ear their
diabolical advice. Just here, with all our admiration for
Napoleon, we are amazed at him. That a man possessing
such great genius, and with such far-reaching intuitions,
should have allowed his mind and deeds to be
influenced by the base flatterers who surrounded him, is
strange indeed. That Napoleon should not have discovered
the Mephistopheles, in Fouché, is surprising; equally
amazing, that he should have become so blinded as to
turn from his truest friends and most unselfish advisers,
and have bared his breast to the poisonous fangs of the
wily serpents, who hissed around him like a nest of rattlesnakes.</p>

<p>That steadfastness of purpose which made Napoleon so
invincible in overcoming the most stupendous difficulties
when his cause was righteous, and which made him the
wonder of the world, became the greatest obstacle in his
way when his cause was wrong and his resolves pernicious.</p>

<p>The very element in his nature which made him transcendent
for good, rendered him also powerful for evil,
when his resolution had once been taken in a wrong direction.
His unconquerable will, which bore him upward
through the most overwhelming difficulties, and crowned
him with well-merited success, when his aspirations were
inspired by true patriotism and the laudable desire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
benefit his country,—that same unconquerable will became
his bane, and led him into the most lamentable
errors when his former high aspirations had been supplanted
by personal ambition and inordinate desire for
power.</p>

<p>We cannot give a consecutive history of Napoleon’s
errors and downfall in this sketch, but they will appear
from time to time, as we trace a short outline of the life
of Josephine. We do not pretend to say that Josephine
always consciously guided Napoleon’s career and moulded
the events of his life. His own genius raised him to his
exalted position, we admit; but we do contend that with
Josephine he prospered, and without her he fell.</p>

<p>And according to many authorities, it was Josephine’s
bridal gift to him that gave him the command of the
army of Italy; for it was Barras who recommended Bonaparte
to the convention; and it was Barras who assured
Madame de Beauharnais that if she married General Bonaparte
he would contrive to have him appointed to that
command.</p>

<p>We have space but to give two scenes in the life of
Josephine before she became Madame Bonaparte. The
former occurred upon the island of Martinique, when
Josephine was a young girl; the latter, after she had
become Vicomtesse de Beauharnais.</p>

<p>One day, when Josephine was about fifteen years of
age, she was walking through the spacious grounds of her
uncle’s West Indian plantation, in the island of Martinique,
when she observed a number of negro girls gathered
around an old woman who was engaged in telling their
fortunes. Josephine, with girlish curiosity, drew near;
whereupon, the old sibyl seized her hand, and, reading the
lines there, appeared to be greatly moved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span></p>

<p>“What do you see?” inquired Josephine.</p>

<p>“You will not believe me if I speak,” answered the
fortune-teller.</p>

<p>“Speak on, good mother,” said Josephine; “what
have I to fear or hope?”</p>

<p>“On your own head be it then; listen,” said the old
sibyl.</p>

<p>“You will be married soon; that union will not be
happy; you will become a widow, and then,—you will be
queen of France! Some happy years will be yours; but
you will die in a hospital, amid civil commotion;” after
saying which, the old woman speedily disappeared.</p>

<p>Josephine thought little of this matter at the time, and
only laughed about it with her friends; and when she was
residing at Navarre, after the divorce, she thus commented
upon it:—</p>

<p>“On account of the seeming absurdity of this <i>ridiculous
prediction</i>, I thought little of the affair. But afterwards,
when my husband had perished on the scaffold, in spite
of my better judgment this prediction forcibly recurred
to my mind; and though I was then myself in prison,
the transaction assumed a less improbable character, and
when I, myself, had been also condemned to die, I comforted
my companions, who were weeping around me, by
smilingly exclaiming:—</p>

<p>“‘That not only should I not die, but that I should
become <i>Queen of France</i>’.</p>

<p>“‘Why then do you not appoint your household?’ asked
Madame d’Aiguillon, who was also one of the prisoners
of the Revolution.</p>

<p>“‘Ah! that is true,—I had forgotten. Well, my dear,
you shall be maid of honor; I promise you the situation.’</p>

<p>“Upon this the tears of those ladies flowed more abundantly;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
for they thought, on seeing my coolness at such
a crisis, that misfortune had affected my reason. Such,
ladies, is the truth about this so celebrated prophecy.
The end gives me but little inquietude. I live here peacefully
in retirement; I have no concern with politics; I
endeavor to do all the good in my power; and thus I
hope to die calmly in my bed.”</p>

<p>After the death of the Vicomte de Beauharnais on the
scaffold, his wife Josephine, who had also been imprisoned
by the Jacobins, was at length condemned to die.</p>

<p>A few days before her terrible doom was to have been
sealed, Josephine and Madame de Fontenay, also a prisoner,
were standing together at the barred window of their
prison. M. Tallien, a man of much influence with the
rising power which was opposing the tyranny of Robespierre,
was in love with Madame de Fontenay, and daily
walked past the convent of the Carmelites, where Josephine
and the other ladies of high birth were imprisoned.</p>

<p>Observing M. Tallien, Madame de Fontenay made a
sign for him to draw near, and she then dropped from the
window a piece of cabbage-leaf, in which she had enclosed
the following note:—</p>

<p>“My trial is decreed; the result is certain. If you
love me as you say, urge every means to save France
and me.”</p>

<p>Roused by the danger of her whom he loved, M. Tallien
proceeded to the convention, and making an impassioned
and eloquent speech, denouncing Robespierre, he turned
the tide of popular opinion against the tyrant, and in a
short time Robespierre’s head fell under the bloody guillotine,
where he had already caused so many thousands to
perish.</p>

<p>The manner in which Josephine received the news of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
her enemy’s death was strange and interesting. It was
the day before that upon which it had been decreed that
Madame de Beauharnais should be put to death. Josephine
was standing at the window of her prison, calmly
gazing upon the outward world, while her fellow-prisoners
were weeping around, overcome with the thought of the
terrible doom which awaited their loved friend. But
Josephine’s fortitude did not desert her, and she was endeavoring
to comfort her mourning companions, when her
attention was arrested by a woman in the street below,
who seemed trying to give her some information by various
strange signs.</p>

<p>At first the woman held up her robe, pointing to it
several times. Josephine called out through the grated
window, “<i>Robe?</i>” and the woman eagerly made a sign
of assent; and picking up a stone, which in French is
<i>pierre</i>, she held it up. Josephine cried out, “<i>Pierre?</i>”
and the woman joyfully nodded, and then pointed first to
her robe and then to the stone. Whereupon Josephine
wonderingly exclaimed, “<i>Robespierre?</i>” and the woman
again assented with every mark of delight, and continued
to draw her hand around her throat, making the signs of
cutting off a head. The glad cry soon resounded through
the prison, “<i>Robespierre is dead!</i>”</p>

<p>Thus was the axe lifted from the neck of Josephine,
and she soon walked forth free, saying smilingly to her
friends:—</p>

<p>“You see I am not guillotined; and <i>I shall yet be queen
of France!</i>”</p>

<p>Thus not only had the life of the future empress of
France, but the fate of that great kingdom itself, depended
at one time upon a tiny cabbage-leaf, thrown by
the hand of a feeble woman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<p>After Josephine de Beauharnais was betrothed to General
Bonaparte, on one occasion she requested him to
accompany her to the residence of M. Raguideau, an old
lawyer, who had long been her confidential friend and
adviser, that she might inform him of her coming marriage.
On arriving at the lawyer’s office, Josephine withdrew
her hand from the arm of Bonaparte, and requested
him to wait for her in the outer apartment until she had
spoken with her old friend alone. Neglecting, however,
to close the door which separated the two offices, Bonaparte
was able to overhear the conversation between his
intended bride and the old lawyer.</p>

<p>“M. Raguideau,” said Madame de Beauharnais, “I
have come to inform you of my approaching marriage.”</p>

<p>“And with whom, madame?” exclaimed the astonished
lawyer.</p>

<p>“I am about to marry General Bonaparte, sir.”</p>

<p>“General Bonaparte, do you say? Pshaw, madame! a
soldier of fortune, who has his way to make.”</p>

<p>“He will make it, my good friend!” replied Josephine,
with flushed cheeks.</p>

<p>“When, and how?” was the incredulous retort. “But
first, what is he worth at present?”</p>

<p>“Nothing, save his house in the Rue Chantereine.”</p>

<p>“A <i>shed!</i> A likely fortune, indeed! And so you are
really resolved to marry this adventurer?”</p>

<p>“I am.”</p>

<p>“So much the worse for you, madame.”</p>

<p>“Explain yourself, sir!” said Josephine, with offended
dignity.</p>

<p>“Because, madame, you had much better remain a
widow than marry a paltry general, without either name
or prospects. You must assuredly be mad! Will your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
Bonaparte ever be a Dumouriez or a Pichegru? Will he
ever be the equal of our great republican generals? I
have a right to doubt it. Moreover, let me tell you that
the profession of arms is worthless now; and I would
much rather know that you were about to marry an army-contractor
than General Bonaparte.”</p>

<p>“Every one to his taste, monsieur,” disdainfully replied
Josephine, stung to the quick by the contemptuous
tone of the old man, who had always heretofore been
fatherly to her. “You, sir, it would appear, regard marriage
merely as an affair of finance;” and she rose with
queenly dignity to take her leave.</p>

<p>“And you, madame,” broke in the excited and angry
old man, “you see in it only a matter of sentiment, and
what you, no doubt, call love. Again I repeat, all the
worse for you, madame! all the worse for you! I had
given you more credit for good sense than to suspect that
you would allow yourself to be dazzled by a pair of gold
epaulets. Reflect before you make such a sacrifice;
for rest assured, that if you are rash enough to persist in
this foolish scheme, you will repent your folly all the
days of your life. Who ever heard of a rational woman
throwing herself away upon a man whose whole fortune
consists in his <i>sword</i> and his <i>great-coat?</i>”</p>

<p>General Bonaparte had listened to this extraordinary
conversation with rising excitement; and when he heard
the words “sword” and “great-coat” so contemptuously
uttered, he sprang from his chair, with blazing eyes, forgetting
the presence of the astonished clerks; but, recovering
himself instantly, he sat down again, determined
not to expose himself to ridicule.</p>

<p>Josephine soon appeared, looking highly annoyed and
indignant, followed by the irate old lawyer; but Bonaparte,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
giving him no time for further insult, drew the
hand of his betrothed within his arm, and, making a
silent and contemptuous bow, withdrew.</p>

<p>Josephine had no idea that Bonaparte had been an
unwilling listener; but she noticed his marked increase
of kind and courtly attention on the way home; and not
until the day of the coronation did either Josephine or
Raguideau entertain the slightest suspicion that their conversation
had been overheard by Bonaparte. On the day
of the coronation, when the emperor and empress were
about to proceed to the palace of the archbishop, Napoleon
sent one of his chamberlains to M. Raguideau, with
the command that the emperor desired his immediate
presence at the Tuileries. The astonished lawyer, arriving
with breathless haste, overwhelmed with mingled feelings
of fear and hope at such unexpected summons, was
ushered into the grand <i>salon</i>, where Napoleon, attired in
his royal robes, was conversing with Josephine, who was
also arrayed in her gorgeous coronation costume.</p>

<p>“Ah! here you are at last, M. Raguideau!” said
Napoleon, with a quizzical smile upon his imposing countenance;
“I am very happy to see you!”</p>

<p>“Sire,” began the trembling old man, not knowing
whether that august smile betokened promotion or decapitation.</p>

<p>“My good sir,” continued the emperor, not giving him
time to reply, “do you remember a day in 1796, when I
accompanied to your house Madame de Beauharnais, now
<i>empress</i> of the French?”—emphasizing the word “empress”
with all the depth of his magnetic voice. “Do you
remember the eulogy which you uttered on the military
profession, and the personal panegyric of which I was
the object? Well, what say you <i>now?</i> Were you a true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
prophet? You declared that my fortune would always
consist of my sword and my great-coat; that I should
never make a name nor position, like Dumouriez or
Pichegru; and that Madame de Beauharnais was insane
to sacrifice herself to a ‘<i>mere general</i>.’ I have made my
way, nevertheless, as you perceive, and in despite of your
sagacious predictions. Think you that the ‘<i>army-contractor</i>’
would have bestowed a brighter boon upon his
wife, after eight years of marriage, than a <i>crown</i>, and
that crown the <i>imperial diadem of France?</i>”</p>

<p>As he ceased speaking, Napoleon lovingly raised the
hand of Josephine to his lips, while she looked with
amazement upon this bewildering scene. The poor old
lawyer, overwhelmed with consternation, stood trembling
in dumb despair; his eyes were cast upon the floor, and
his limbs shook as with an ague fit; while the emperor
gazed upon him with an amused smile, highly enjoying
his discomfiture. At last the frightened man stammered:—</p>

<p>“Sire, I could not foresee. Sire, did you really overhear?”</p>

<p>“Every word, M. Raguideau. You are aware that
walls have ears, and I owe you a severe reprisal; for, if
my excellent Josephine had listened to your advice, it
would have cost her a throne, and me the best of wives.
You are a great culprit, M. Raguideau!”</p>

<p>At those terrible words “<i>reprisal</i>” and “<i>culprit</i>,” the
poor old man turned pale as a corpse; his tottering limbs
almost refused to support his agitated form.</p>

<p>“How could I tell? how could I imagine?” he gasped
out; “I thought only of her, of her fatherless children.
I had loved them for years. I was anxious to see them
once more restored to prosperity and happiness.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span></p>

<p>“I believe you,” said the emperor, touched by the
emotion of the gray-haired old man, who had been a
friend to his wife in her days of need; “you could not
tell; you could not foresee;” and for a moment Napoleon
paused, and then continued in more solemn tones, “the
future is beyond the grasp of any living man.” Then, resuming
his bantering way: “So, now, we will return to
the present; and, as I cannot altogether overlook the
injury which you sought to inflict upon me, I condemn
you to go this day to Nôtre Dame, and to witness the
ceremony of my coronation. Not in a corner, not behind
a pillar, which will prevent my having ocular evidence of
your obedience, but in the seat that I shall cause to be
retained for you. Do you hear, sir? I must see you
both in the cathedral and in the line of the procession.”</p>

<p>Transported with the overwhelming relief and the ecstatic
joy of such an honor, the poor old lawyer was
hardly able to express his gratitude, and could scarcely
maintain his dignity as he bowed himself from the royal
presence, and hastened to prepare for the coming august
ceremony.</p>

<p>Napoleon having jested with his wife over the abject
terror of the trembling culprit, the emperor and empress
entered their carriage, and proceeded to the archbishopric.
As they left the cathedral after the magnificent ceremony
of the coronation, Napoleon recognized the old lawyer in
the crowd; and as their eyes met the Emperor smiled graciously
upon his former enemy. The smile was answered
by so profound a bow, that Napoleon afterwards laughingly
declared to Josephine, “that for several seconds he
was in doubt whether the sage prophet of 1796 would
ever be able again to assume the perpendicular.”</p>

<p>During Napoleon’s campaigns, Josephine was at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
times in receipt of news from the army, brought to her
by couriers from Bonaparte. No matter at what time the
despatches arrived, day or night, she always received them
with her own hands, and made inquiries of the courier of
all in the army whom she knew. She would always say
some pleasant thing to him, and reward him with a more
or less costly gift, according to the importance of the news
received.</p>

<p>At one time, when Bourrienne had remarked to Josephine,
“Madame, I really believe that in spite of yourself
you will be made queen or empress,” Josephine
exclaimed: “Bourrienne, such ambition is far from my
thoughts. That I may always continue the wife of the
First Consul, is all that I desire.”</p>

<p>During the Prussian campaign, nothing was talked of
throughout Germany but Napoleon’s generous conduct
with respect to Prince Hatzfeld. Among the letters
seized at Berlin, and delivered to Napoleon, was one
from the prince to the king of Prussia, in which he revealed
the condition and strength of the French army.
The prince was arrested, and tried as a spy, and condemned
to death. The remainder of the scene is described
in Napoleon’s letter to Josephine, which is as follows:—</p>

<p>“I have received your letter, in which you seem to
reproach me for speaking ill of women. It is true that
I dislike female intriguers above all things. I am used to
kind, gentle, and conciliatory women. I love them, and
if they have spoiled me, it is not my fault, but yours.
However, you will see that I have done an act of kindness
to one deserving woman. I allude to Madame de Hatzfeld.
When I showed her her husband’s letter, she stood
weeping, and in a tone of mingled grief and ingenuousness,
said, ‘It is indeed his writing!’ This went to my heart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
and I said: ‘Well, madame, throw the letter into the fire,
and then I shall have no proof against your husband.’ She
burned the letter, and was restored to happiness. Her
husband now is safe; two hours later, and he would have
been lost. You see, therefore, that I like women who are
simple, gentle, and amiable; because they alone resemble
you.”</p>

<p>Josephine’s kindness and consideration for the comfort
of every one in her household, even down to the lowest
menial, was proverbial. When travelling with Napoleon,
a picket-guard was appointed by the emperor for her service.
One cold night, in the early dawn, she heard
marching and coughing under her window. She wondered
who could be out so late in the chill of that hour; and
upon inquiry, she learned that it was the sentinel posted
there. She thereupon sent for the officer of the guard,
and said to him, “Sir, I have no need of a sentinel at
night; these brave men have endured enough in the army
when they followed it to the wars; they must rest while
in my service. I don’t want them to catch cold.” The
officer, smiling at the apprehensive solicitude of the empress,
and touched by her unexpected kindness, dismissed
the sentinel, and his place was not supplied.</p>

<p>Napoleon is said to have talked but little. When out
of his own house, if he chanced to stop and speak with
any one, it was considered of enough importance to be
remarked and reported. The following is Josephine’s
portrait of Napoleon at home: “He had a fine intellect,
a sensible and grateful heart, simple tastes, and the qualities
of an amiable man; to the sentiments of an honest
man, he united a prodigious local memory.”</p>

<p>When Josephine spoke of her husband, she always said,
“The emperor says,” “the emperor wishes,” “the emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
orders,” etc. She very rarely called him by name
in public, and in private she called him Bonaparte; while
her tender name for him was <i>mon ami</i>. When speaking
of her, Napoleon usually called her <i>the empress</i>, or
he would say, “I am going to see <i>my wife</i>”; but in addressing
her he called her <i>Josephine</i>, unless he spoke with
severity or on some serious occasion, when he called her
<i>Madame</i>, without other title or name.</p>

<p>It cannot be denied that Josephine had a great weakness
for extravagant jewels and adornments; but as she
dressed always with perfect taste and elegance, and as
she was as lavish in her bounties as she was in her personal
expenditures, she may be pardoned this feminine
weakness. She at least never offended the eyes of
admirers of good taste, and her pleasing person, so
becomingly adorned, was one of the most charming sights
of the court of the empire.</p>

<p>This was another cause of the jealousy of her sisters-in-law;
and even Pauline, the Bonaparte beauty, was often
most sorely chagrined to find her own boasted charms
thrown in the shade by the refined elegance and queenly
bearing of the emperor’s wife.</p>

<p>An amusing story is told of the mortification of this
proud beauty upon one grand occasion, when she had
resolved for once to outshine her hated sister-in-law.</p>

<p>Pauline, Madame Le Clerc, after wearing her widow’s
weeds for as short a time as possible after the death of
her first husband, General Le Clerc, had wedded a real
prince, and was accordingly to make her <i>début</i> at court
as Princess Borghèse.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 467px;">
<img src="./girlsBooksFamousQueens_files/i-428.jpg" width="467" height="449" alt="drawing">
<div class="caption">NAPOLÉON.</div>
</div>

<p>Pauline has kept her own counsel about her <i>grande
toilette</i> for that momentous occasion; but the rumor is
afloat that she intends to make a <i>grand coup</i> with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
gorgeous appearance, and quite extinguish her august
sister-in-law.</p>

<p>Josephine, having heard that she was to be crushed
into utter insignificance by the vain beauty, quietly determined
a little stratagem of her own. Confident of being
mistress in the art of dress, she accordingly resolved to
assume a costume which should delight by its very simplicity.
But a simplicity so artistically arranged that the
very splendor of her rival should but heighten the effect
of her own toilet. Her dress was of the finest Indian
muslin, bordered with gold and embroidery, and gracefully
draped to show the perfect elegance of her figure.
Her hair was dressed <i>à la grecque</i>, and banded with pearls,
while antique gems and pearls formed her sole ornaments.</p>

<p>“<i>Ravissante!</i>” exclaimed her ladies, as she entered
the <i>salon;</i> and even Napoleon’s usual gravity relents, as
he cries:—</p>

<p>“<i>Josephine, je suis jaloux! Tu es divine!</i>” and he
kisses her on the forehead, pinching her ear laughingly,
which was his favorite manner of bestowing a gracious
caress.</p>

<p>The time passes, but no princess. Napoleon impatiently
retires from the <i>salon;</i> his time is too precious to
wait longer the “official visit,” as he calls it, of the prince
and princess.</p>

<p>At length the clatter of horses’ hoofs is heard. A carriage
grand enough, with its gilding and emblazonry, to
have borne the <i>Grand Monarque</i> himself, dashes into the
<i>Cour d’Honneur</i> of St. Cloud.</p>

<p>Six gayly caparisoned horses are harnessed to this gorgeous
vehicle, and a large retinue of outriders surround
it, bearing torches. On the grand staircase are stationed
the entire staff of domestics to receive their princely
guests.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span></p>

<p>Presently the <i>huissier</i> opens the doors of the <i>salon</i>,
and announces with becoming grandiloquence:—</p>

<p>“<i>Monseigneur le Prince, and Madame la Princesse
Borghèse</i>.”</p>

<p>The <i>grande entrée</i> is made with imposing hauteur, and
Pauline sees with satisfaction that she has made a sensation.
But her vain heart is ruffled because she is obliged
to cross the room to Josephine, instead of being met by
her, as <i>la grande princesse</i> had of course expected.</p>

<p>But she comforted her wounded pride with the thought
that this promenade would give her the opportunity to
display her velvet train embroidered with diamonds.</p>

<p>Pauline was indeed magnificent. Her costume was a
pale green velvet embroidered with gold, and thickly
sprinkled with flashing brilliants. The front of her dress
was a <i>tablier</i> of diamonds, with diamond stomacher, and
the same glistening jewels upon her sleeves. Her handsome
head was adorned with a diadem of emeralds and
diamonds, and the same gems sparkled upon snowy arms,
wrists, and throat. In fact, she was loaded with the entire
wealth of diamonds possessed by the princely family
of Borghèse; and as it was reported that when she came
back from St. Domingo, where her former husband died,
she had guarded carefully a coffin, containing the supposed
remains of her late husband, but in reality filled
with diamonds and other precious stones. If this was
true, Pauline doubtless had diamonds of her own to add
to the vaunted store of the family of her second princely
husband.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, Pauline flashed in diamonds from
head to foot; nay more, even to the end of her gorgeous
train, where the same rich jewels also sparkled.</p>

<p>She was indeed dazzling!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>

<p>Josephine and Pauline are at length seated side by
side. The proud princess is forced to acknowledge that
Josephine’s toilet is charming; and all beholders are confirmed
in their opinion that Madame Bonaparte’s taste is
faultless.</p>

<p>But horrors! What has happened? Pauline, <i>la princesse</i>,
has grown pale as death. Is she ill? Oh! worse
than that. Oh, awful catastrophe! Pauline, gazing into
a large mirror before her, expecting to be ravished with
her own beauty, perceives this dreadful fact. The furniture
and draperies of the newly furnished <i>salon</i>, while
giving full effect to Josephine’s costume, actually transform
herself into a hideous spectacle. Wearing a <i>green
velvet gown</i>, she has seated herself upon a <i>blue velvet sofa!</i>
It is positively <i>too shocking</i> for her nerves to endure.
Had her boasted triumph encountered such ignominious
defeat? Hastily rising, she made her adieus, and departed
to weep in mortified chagrin and baffled pride.
Poor Pauline! kind-hearted Josephine had not intended
to achieve such an unexpected triumph.</p>

<p>The Empress Josephine was very generous to her attendant
ladies, often making them costly presents. As
she frequently gave them handsome costumes and pretty
novelties which she had worn but once or twice, the
ladies at length entered into quite a trade with certain
Jews, who came to the court to display their merchandise.
As the robes of the empress were often too rich for the
ladies who received them to wear themselves, they exchanged
them for piece-goods, which the Jewish merchants
brought for sale. These garments of the empress became
quite the rage; and at one ball, Josephine might have
beheld the ladies in an entire quadrille, arrayed in her
cast-off robes. Even princesses were frequently the purchasers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
of these gowns from the Jews, who had obtained
them in exchange for the merchandise with which they
had supplied the ladies of Josephine’s court.</p>

<p>At one time an ambassador arrived from Persia, bringing
very magnificent presents to the Emperor Napoleon
and costly cashmeres to Josephine. For some time his
Persian Excellency was all the rage, and the ladies of the
French court vied with each other in endeavoring to show
attention to these eastern guests. The parties given by
the Persian ambassador and his suite, at their residences,
were largely attended, and much curiosity was evinced to
partake of the foreign tea and queer cakes offered by
their Persian hosts.</p>

<p>The empress at length determined to attend one of
their parties incognito, being accompanied by several of
her ladies. On being introduced to the ambassador,
Josephine received a gracious smile, and the Persian presented
her with a small bottle of attar of roses, a kind of
present which, among the Persians, denoted a mark of
high honor and respect.</p>

<p>Josephine tasted several mysterious Persian dishes, and
expressed admiration of his Excellency’s pipe, which was
brought to him by two slaves, who kneeled when they
offered it to their august master. Josephine noticed that
the tips of his Excellency’s finger-nails were colored with
different tints.</p>

<p>The ambassador being impressed with the manner and
grace of the empress, invited her to be seated by his side
on his divan. She graciously declined the attention, saying
that such an honor belonged only to privileged persons,
fearing that her identity would be made known.
The Persian then asked, through his interpreter, if she
would be willing to go and reside with him in Persia,
promising that he would give her a high position.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span></p>

<p>Scarcely restraining her mirth, Josephine replied that
she was married and had two children, and that her duty
and interests would keep her in France. And with as
much haste as courtesy would allow, the empress and her
ladies retired from the presence of their Persian host.</p>

<p>On the day of the ambassador’s public presentation
at court, Josephine, arrayed in all her imperial magnificence,
received him with a gracious smile. The poor,
dumfounded Persian, who recognized in the empress
the woman whom he had vainly tried to captivate, was
completely amazed, and his manner and attitude expressed
his astonished mortification.</p>

<p>But Josephine, with winning smile, quickly relieved
him of his embarrassment, saying, in her sweet persuasive
tones:—</p>

<p>“You must admit, Monsieur l’Ambassadeur, that I had
good reason for telling you that I preferred to remain in
France. If you think well of me, you will remain faithful
to that beautiful wife of yours.” And with a sign of
respect, the humiliated Persian withdrew.</p>

<p>At Josephine’s early receptions as wife of the First
Consul, the costumes of the guests were very heterogeneous
in style. The fashions of the Republic had been copied
after ancient Greek and Roman styles; and the ladies of
the Republic flaunted their Grecian tunics and Roman
sandals with great pride. But after a time it was
remarked “that military boots and pantaloons, clanking
swords and cockades, were in a considerable minority,
and that silk stockings, shoes with buckles, dress swords,
and <i>chapeaux sous le bras</i> were the rule. Some of the
company had, however, endeavored to spare their feelings
too complete a shock, by an attempt to unite the past and
the present. While returning to powder and embroidery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
lace ruffles and cravats, they contrived to retain in their
costumes some reminiscence of the fast vanishing and
much regretted ‘<i>sans-culottism</i>’ of the Republic. This
resulted in amusing and startling incongruities.”</p>

<p>But during the empire, Napoleon was particular about
the etiquette of his court. He regarded it as the chief
barrier of the throne, and of great importance. He
caused an exact account of all the ceremonies in use at the
courts of Louis XIV. and Louis XV. to be drawn up, and
he directed the most scrupulous attention to be paid to their
performance. Josephine was sufficiently a daughter of
the Revolution to smile at too strict etiquette; she said:
“It was perhaps appropriate for princesses, born to the
throne and accustomed to the restraints it imposes; but
she, who had lived so many years as a private person,
ought, she considered, to be less exacting, less severely
punctilious in her intercourse with those who knew and
remembered the circumstances of her former life.” “And
although she learned to wear her crown and mantle of
state and to sit on her throne right royally, she was ever
unfailingly indulgent in the matter of etiquette, and always
pleased to throw aside its restraints.”</p>

<p>After the imperial decree had ennobled many to whom
the mysteries of the court had hitherto been sealed books,
very amusing incidents occurred. The Faubourg St. Germain
resented the indignity which had been offered to
their patrician prejudices; and the newly created nobles
were often treated with superb disdain by those entitled
to such rank from birth.</p>

<p>“The Duchesse de Chevreuse desired her waiting-woman
to inform her laundress that she should no longer
intrust her with her linen, until she became a countess;
and the Comte de Brissac addressed a note to his boot-maker
as follows:—<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span></p>

<p>“‘My dear baron! do not fail to bring me my boots to-morrow.’
And when on the next day the astonished
tradesman assured him that he had been the recipient of
no such title, De Brissac exclaimed with elegant impertinence:
‘Can this be possible? You really astonish me!
Console yourself, however, Maizenat; for rest assured
that you will be included in the next baking.’”</p>

<p>But it was hardly to be wondered at, perhaps, that the
old nobles sneered at some of these new-titled persons,
whose own presumptuous pride made them fit subjects for
mirth. This throng of new courtiers, most of whom had
sworn eternal hatred to kings and royalty, now danced
attendance at the <i>levées</i> of the emperor, and vied with
each other to obtain a look or word from his imperial
highness, that they might repay him for it with the pompous
titles of “Sire,” and “Your Majesty,” which they did
with an air of self-gratulation, which appeared as if the
individual considered himself to be ennobled by the privilege
of merely uttering the magic words. Among the
strange actions related of some of these “<i>newly baked
dignitaries</i>,” one or two are quite amusing.</p>

<p>The wife of a marshal purchased several dresses of old
brocade, such as were worn at the Court of Louis XV.,
and kept them spread out upon chairs in the hall leading
to her bedroom, as if placed there to air. When her
curious visitors asked her what she was going to do with
them, she replied with apparent carelessness, under
which lurked much pompous pride: “Do with them?
Oh! nothing at all; but they belonged to my grandmother,
and I wish to keep them as long as I can for her
sake.”</p>

<p>Books on heraldry brought fabulous prices; and the
father behind his counter, and the mother at her wash-tub,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>
were entertained by their pretty daughters, endeavoring
to master the high-bred French titles of the <i>ancien régime</i>.</p>

<p>One soap-dealer, whose daughter had married an officer
in the army, and had embellished the panels of her carriage
with a gloved hand grasping a sword,—the military
crest of her husband,—innocently thanked his daughter
for having tried to copy the golden arm which figured
above his shop-door; though he regretted that she should
have had it painted to look like iron, and generously
stated that had he known of it, he would willingly have
paid the difference of cost himself.</p>

<p>The return to Paris of several <i>grandes dames</i> promised
a gradual reorganization of “<i>la bonne compagnie</i>,”
and several of the contractors’ wives were ambitious to be
received in the Faubourg St. Germain; and one of them,
Madame Privas, who was desirous of opening her <i>salon</i> to
the <i>beau monde</i>, having read Madame de Genlis’ work,
“Adèle et Théodore,” at once exclaimed to her husband:
“Privas! this is the lady for us.” Whereupon
Madame Privas arrayed herself in resplendent robes, and
attended by a negro servant in Moorish costume, she
entered her gorgeous carriage and proceeded to take
Madame de Genlis by storm.</p>

<p>She had not the least doubt of the success of her
errand, which was no less than the attempt to secure
Madame de Genlis, who had returned to Paris in pinched
circumstances, to come to her magnificent hotel in the Rue
St. Dominique, and as a lady, receive for her: in short,
put her in the way of learning the old etiquette with which
she should honor people who were quite <i>comme il faut</i>.
And so with pompous brusqueness she announces the
object of her visit to Madame de Genlis. She would give
her a salary of twelve thousand francs. She would promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
not to tyrannize over her, and even if she had a dear
friend she also would be welcome. What more could she
require?</p>

<p>“Madame, I thank you for your obliging offer, which I
have the honor to inform you it is not in my power to
accept,” replied Madame de Genlis, rising with the
courtly manner of a <i>grande dame</i> of the court of the
<i>Grand Monarque</i>.</p>

<p>“You refuse it!” cried Madame Privas in astonishment.
“Why, I offer much more than you can get for your
books. And besides, you would have friends in us;—friends
with a fortune of five millions. <i>C’est beau, ca!
eh?</i>”</p>

<p>“Madame,” replied Madame de Genlis, “I have
answered you. It is impossible.”</p>

<p>“Well, adieu then, my <i>bonne dame</i>. Privas and I
made sure you would jump at the offer. In case you
should change your mind, I’ll leave you my address.
Write me, if you think better of it.” And with her plumes
waving in ruffled pride, and her velvets and satins rustling
in their gorgeous costliness, Madame Privas bounced out
of the room, forgetting her assumed elegance of manner
at the affront offered to her darling dollars.</p>

<p>Josephine’s manners, “<i>en representation</i>,” were charming.
She appeared a very queen at the emperor’s public
receptions. Her air and attitude were dignified, graceful,
and yet natural. She conversed with ease and fluency,
employing the choicest terms of expression; and the spectator
could not resist a pleased astonishment at the gracious
bearing which charmed all classes of society, and
at her alluring tact which enabled her to address crowds
of persons in quick succession, and yet with a pleasing
and appropriate word to each, turning with equal ease
from a tradesman to a monarch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>

<p>The emperor was one day about to undertake some important
business, when Josephine besought him to put it
off for a time, remarking that it was Friday, which was
regarded as an unlucky day. Napoleon replied: “’Tis
so perhaps to you, Madame, but it is the most fortunate
in my life. I never shall forget that it was the day of
our marriage.” The empress was deeply touched at this
mark of devotion from her husband, and she ceased to
enforce her request.</p>

<p>The time for the coronation ceremony had arrived.
Josephine felt the solemnity as well as the grandeur of
the occasion, as is evinced from these few lines written to
Pope Pius VII. at this time:—</p>

<p>“Ah! truly do I feel, that in becoming empress of the
French, I ought also to become to them as a mother at
the same time. What would it avail to bear them in my
heart, if I proved my affections for them only by my intentions?
<i>Deeds</i> are what the people have a right to
demand from those who govern them.”</p>

<p>And truly, Josephine exemplified her words by her
actions.</p>

<p>On the 2d of December, 1804, all was stir in Paris and
the Tuileries from an early hour.</p>

<p>“On this morning, which was to witness the completion
of her greatness, Josephine rose about eight o’clock, and
immediately commenced her momentous <i>grande toilette</i>.
The body drapery of the empress was of white satin,
beautifully embroidered in gold, and ornamented on the
breast with diamonds. The mantle was of crimson velvet,
lined with satin and ermine, studded with golden
bees, and fastened by an aigrette of diamonds.</p>

<p>“The coronation jewels consisted of a crown, a diadem,
and a ceinture. The first used for the actual crowning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
and worn only on state occasions, consisted of eight
branches, four wrought in palm, and four in myrtle leaves
of gold, incrusted with diamonds; round the circlet ran a
corded fillet set with eight very large emeralds, and the
bandeau which immediately enclosed the head, shone with
resplendent amethysts.</p>

<p>“The diadem worn before the coronation, and on the
more ordinary state occasions, was composed of four rows
of the finest pearls interlaced with foliage of diamonds,
the workmanship of which equalled the materials; in
front were several brilliants, the largest weighing one
hundred and forty-nine grains. The ceinture was of gold,
so pure as to be quite elastic, enriched with thirty-nine
rose-colored diamonds.</p>

<p>“Napoleon’s coronation robes were equally magnificent.
His close dress was of white velvet, embroidered in gold,
with diamond buttons; his stockings of white silk, the
gussets wrought in gold, harmonized with the buskins of
white velvet laced and bordered with gold; his upper
garment, as also the short mantle, were of crimson velvet,
richly embroidered in gold, with diamond fastenings.
This mantle was similar to that of the empress, but much
heavier, weighing upwards of eighty pounds.</p>

<p>“‘All very fine, Monsieur le Drôle,’ said Napoleon, to
his favorite valet, playfully pinching his ear; ‘all very
fine; but we shall see the accounts.’</p>

<p>“At eleven precisely the cavalcade moved from the
Tuileries towards Nôtre Dame. The imperial carriage,
drawn by eight bays, had been constructed with the entire
panelling of glass, a circumstance which accounts for the
mistake made by their Majesties, who first seated themselves,
like criminals, with their backs to the horses.
Josephine was the first to discover this error, which she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
instantly rectified by lightly assuming the proper position
saying at the same time to the emperor:—</p>

<p>“‘<i>Mon ami</i>, unless you prefer riding <i>vis-à-vis</i>, this is
your seat,’ pointing to the rich cushion on the right. Napoleon,
laughing heartily at his blunder, moved to the
place indicated.</p>

<p>“The procession advanced, attended by ten thousand
horsemen, the flower of ‘Gallic chivalry,’ who defiled
between double lines of infantry, selected from the bravest
soldiers, and extending above a mile and a half; while
more than four hundred thousand spectators filled up
every space whence a lance could be obtained.</p>

<p>“The thunders of innumerable artillery, the acclamations
of the assembled multitude, expressed the general enthusiasm;
and, as if to light up the gorgeous spectacle, the
sun suddenly broke through the mists which till then had
hung heavily over the city. The <i>cortège</i> stopped at the
archiepiscopal palace, whence a temporary covered gallery,
hung with the banners of the sixteen cohorts of the Legion
of Honor, conducted into the interior of the cathedral
and to the throne.</p>

<p>“To this latter was an ascent of twenty-two semicircular
steps, covered with blue cloth, gemmed with
golden bees, and crowded with the grand officers of the
empire.</p>

<p>“On the throne itself, hung with crimson velvet, under
a canopy of the same, appeared Napoleon, with Josephine
on his left, attended by the princesses of the empire, and
on his right his two brothers, with the archchancellor and
archtreasurer.</p>

<p>“The religious ceremony continued nearly four hours,
enlivened by music composed for the occasion, and sung
by more than three hundred performers. The martial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
band was still more numerous, which executed in the intervals
marches afterwards adopted and still used in the
armies of France.</p>

<p>“Napoleon, in the midst of the ceremony, stood up and
laid his hand upon the imperial crown,—a simple diadem
of gold wrought into a chaplet of interwoven oak and
laurel,—and placed it on his own head. Afterward, Napoleon
took the crown destined for the empress, and, first
putting it for an instant on his own, placed it upon his
consort’s brow, as she knelt before him on the platform of
the throne.</p>

<p>“The appearance of Josephine was at this moment
most touching. Even then she had not forgotten that she
was once an ‘obscure woman’; tears of deep emotion
fell from her eyes; she remained for a moment kneeling,
with hands crossed upon her bosom, then, slowly and
gracefully rising, fixed upon her husband a look of gratitude
and tenderness. Napoleon returned the glance. It
was a silent but conscious interchange of the hopes, the
promises, and the memories of years.</p>

<p>“Cardinal Fesch, as grand almoner of France, now
placed the Gospels on the throne; Napoleon stood up,
laid his hand on the sacred volume, and in his deep and
solemn tones pronounced the oaths with such firmness
and elevation of voice, that each word was distinctly
heard by the vast assembly.</p>

<p>“Shouts of ‘Long live the emperor! God bless the
empress!’ resounded through the cathedral, and were
caught and repeated by the multitude without; the organ
pealed forth <i>Te Deum</i>, and the imposing ceremony was
over.</p>

<p>“The <i>cortège</i> re-entered the palace at half-past six in
the evening. Josephine retired to her closet to give vent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
in secret to the fulness of her heart, and to implore the
protection of Him by whom kings reign.”</p>

<p>Josephine’s mode of life after she became empress is
thus described: “At the Tuileries, at St. Cloud, and during
the grand journeys of the court, her habit was to rise
at eight in the morning, and commence her toilet. While
her hair was being dressed, she would glance over half a
dozen journals, and receive her <i>modistes</i>, or such other
persons as she could not admit into the <i>salon</i>. When she
was fully dressed, which operation lasted ordinarily about
an hour, she would pass into the <i>salon</i> at ten or eleven
o’clock, where she found the <i>dames de service</i> and those
whom she had invited to breakfast with her. At noon
she sat at table at least an hour. Breakfast was in some
sort her only meal, for, on leaving her bed, she was in the
habit of taking nothing but a cup of tea with a little
citron. I do not speak of her breakfasting with the
emperor; for he was always so engaged that he scarcely
had time to eat. After breakfast, if the weather was
good, she would ride out in a calèche, and go to Malmaison
or on a hunting party.</p>

<p>“In case she did not go out, she received calls from all
such persons as had obtained the promise of a meeting, of
which she was advised either by the <i>dame d’honneur</i>, or
the <i>chamberlain de service</i>. These two functionaries could
introduce only such persons as the empress was unacquainted
with, or knew but slightly, whilst all the ladies
who were admitted to her court came whenever they
pleased, without a card of invitation, unless there was a
concert or a spectacle,—a matter appertaining to the emperor’s
chief chamberlain.</p>

<p>“From breakfast until four o’clock, Josephine would
receive two or three private visits in her separate apartment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
or repose upon a sofa; at four she retired to her
cabinet, undressed, went to reading, and took a little refreshment.
This lasted till five, when a second toilet
commenced. She rarely received a call at this time,
because it was the hour at which the emperor came, unless
engaged in council.”</p>

<p>M’lle Avrillion, <i>femme de chambre</i> of the Empress
Josephine, tells several amusing stories regarding these
visits of Napoleon while his wife was making her <i>grande
toilette;</i> and the many suggestions he made as to the becomingness
of certain attire, and his marked antipathy to
some styles. The poor <i>femme de chambre</i> dreaded these
visits as much as Josephine enjoyed them, for the emperor
would always turn the entire wardrobe topsy-turvy
in making the selections of his favorite costumes, and the
jewel-caskets would suffer equal disarrangement. On one
occasion, when Josephine had unconsciously donned an
attire displeasing to the taste of her husband, he ruthlessly
spattered ink upon the obnoxious gown, so that the amiable
empress was obliged to remove the offending robe,
and array herself to please her particular lord.</p>

<p>The emperor and empress usually dined together alone
at six o’clock, and afterwards Josephine again entered
the <i>salon</i>, where she found the <i>dames de service</i>. In the
evening, the ministers, marshals, generals, and others
made their calls. Josephine conversed with ease with
every one, now and then playing a game of backgammon
or whist. If the emperor came in, which was never
before nine o’clock, he remained only about a quarter of
an hour, unless he wished to form a party at play, and
then he would appoint the persons to compose it. His
party always consisted of ladies, never of gentlemen.
But woe betide his partner! for such was the preoccupation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
of his mind that he paid no attention to the card he
was playing, and did not notice his mistakes. No one
dared to make any remark upon his mode of playing.
After going through with this kind of game, the emperor
left the apartment, Josephine meanwhile remaining in
the <i>salon</i> until it was time to retire.</p>

<p>At Malmaison, the only difference in her mode of life
was that she saw somewhat less company, and spent much
time in walking through the delightful grounds of this
rustic retreat. She had established at Malmaison a
botanical garden, a menagerie, and a school of agriculture.
Josephine preserved her simple tastes and her love
for rural life even after she became empress. One of her
greatest delights was the embellishment of her beautiful
gardens. She was well versed in botany and natural
history, and France and Europe are indebted to her for
the camellia. Napoleon’s happiest days were spent at
Malmaison; and after the divorce, he continued to visit
Josephine at this retreat. He would lead her into the
park, remain an hour or two, bring her back to the <i>salon</i>,
and then get into his carriage. She received him with
perfect politeness and dignity of manner, going forward
to meet him; and when he left, accompanying him to the
door of the vestibule.</p>

<p>The appearance of Josephine after she became empress,
is thus described: “Her features were small and finely
modelled, the curves tending rather to fulness and the
profile inclining to Grecian, but without any statue-like
coldness of outline. The habitual character of her countenance
was a placid sweetness, which perhaps would
have given at first an impression of lack of energy. But
this could have been for an instant only, for the real
charm of this mild countenance resided in its power of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
varied expression, changing with each vicissitude of
thought and sentiment. ‘Never’ says a very honest
admirer, ‘did any woman better justify the saying, The
eyes are the mirror of the soul.’ Josephine’s were of
a deep blue, clear and brilliant, even imposing in their
expression when turned fully upon any one; but in her
usual manner they lay half concealed beneath their long
and silky eyelashes. She had a habit of looking thus
with a mild, subdued glance upon those she loved, throwing
into her regard such winning tenderness as might not
easily be resisted; and even in his darkest moods, Napoleon
confessed its tranquillizing power. Josephine’s long
hair ‘was glossy chestnut brown,’ whose sunny richness
harmonized delightfully with a clear and transparent complexion
and neck of almost dazzling whiteness. Her eyebrows
were a shade darker, arching regularly, and pencilled
with extreme delicacy. The perfect modulation of her
voice constituted one of her most pleasing attractions, and
rendered her conversation extremely captivating.”</p>

<p>It was difficult for Napoleon ever to resist the persuasive
voice of Josephine.</p>

<p>On the eve of Napoleon’s departure for Germany, in
April, 1809, having taken leave of Josephine, she had retired
to her apartment, and thrown herself upon her bed
in deep distress, because she could not obtain his consent
to allow her to accompany him to Strasburg.</p>

<p>The emperor, returning unexpectedly to her room at
the last moment, said to Josephine:—</p>

<p>“You have played the part of empress long enough;
you must now become again the wife of a general. I
leave immediately; you will accompany me to Strasburg.”</p>

<p>Josephine herself thus tells the story:—</p>

<p>“I was not at all prepared for the journey, for only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
few days before he had refused to permit me to accompany
him on the campaign. At three o’clock in the
morning we were travelling speedily on the Alsace road.
My husband scarcely gave me time to throw on a night-cloak,
and all my women had left the château <i>en déshabillé;</i>
so that when morning came, the officers who accompanied
us could scarcely preserve their gravity at seeing
us in such a plight. Napoleon was extreme in every
thing, and it was never until the decisive moment came
that he expressed his final resolution. I had been so long
accustomed to his singular character, that I ceased to be
astonished at the striking contrasts which it exhibited.
Our journey was full of gayety; we met sundry original
characters on the way, who furnished us abundance of
amusement. We arrived at Strasburg. My husband had
a secret presentiment that he should return victorious.
He said to me, on leaving me:—</p>

<p>“‘Josephine watches over all that I love, and my
guardian angel will never cease to utter her prayers for
the safety and success of her husband.’</p>

<p>“He knew me well, that mortal whose astonishing
destiny had opened to him the road to the most splendid
throne on earth. I cherished not a thought, I formed not
a wish, which was not directed to his glory. If certain
political drones have dared accuse me of levity in my
conduct, let those unjust censors remember that it was
under the mask of sincere friendship that I sought to
overawe certain powerful personages. Had I regarded
them with an eye of indifference, they might have surrounded
Napoleon with perils from which no human prudence
could have rescued him. Often did I, in concert
with him, carry on a correspondence. I flattered all parties,
for I love to do justice to all. When Napoleon supposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
he had grounds of complaint against any of his
military officers, I warmly pleaded their cause. He would
tell me:—</p>

<p>“‘It depends only on me whether I will be rid of that
officer. I have only to pronounce his doom.’</p>

<p>“‘You are right,’ I would reply; ‘you are right; but
such language does not become your generous and noble
nature.’</p>

<p>“‘And who can oppose me in it!’ was his quick reply.</p>

<p>“‘Yourself, Napoleon. ’Twould arm against your
person a multitude of brave men who are necessary to
you. Certainly, a great man should fear nothing; but
he captivates all hearts when he pardons. The first
function of kings and the firmest pillar of a throne is
justice.’”</p>

<p>Thus Josephine’s influence was always on the side of
mercy and justice. She possessed the most perfect tact,
which rendered her address irresistibly winning when
partisans were to be gained for Napoleon. She was entirely
engrossed in the welfare and glory of him to whom
her heart was most unselfishly devoted and loyal. She
gained for him friends on every side; as Napoleon himself
acknowledged, saying, “I conquer empires; but Josephine
wins hearts.” Bonaparte was never so prosperous,
so well-served, and so well-beloved, as during the years
when he was blessed with the counsels and aided by the
adoring love of the faithful woman, who was always his
best adviser and most constant friend.</p>

<p>When on one occasion Josephine warned Napoleon to
be on his guard against the advice which might be given
him by his flatterers, he replied:—</p>

<p>“You are right, Madame, I know how to guard myself
against all their influences. You are my <i>wife</i> and <i>friend</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
I want none other. Your lot is bound to mine forever;
and woe to that one of us who shall be the first to break
our oath.”</p>

<p>And yet in 1809, he could not guard himself against
the “bees” of his court, who hummed in his ears:—</p>

<p>“You must separate from the Empress Josephine. A
princess of the blood of the Cæsars will esteem it a glory
to give heirs to the great Napoleon. Then will his dynasty
be established forever.”</p>

<p>The divorce in 1809 was brought about by the joint
efforts of all the members of the Bonaparte family, aided
by some of Napoleon’s most confidential servants, whom
Josephine, either as Madame Bonaparte, or empress, had
failed to make her friends, notwithstanding her ceaseless
endeavors to harmonize all the hostile elements around
her. Even as early as the time when Napoleon was in
Egypt, these intriguers first tried to lay snares for the
unsuspicious and magnanimous Josephine, and various
scandals were originated and reported to the absent
Bonaparte.</p>

<p>Junot was made their tool either willingly or unwillingly,
and the evil whispers became louder and louder. During
the first months of the Egyptian expedition, Bonaparte’s
letters to his wife were affectionate and confiding. But
the poison was soon at work, and the rumors which Junot
had repeated to Bonaparte roused his jealous anger.</p>

<p>Poor Josephine knew naught of these dread scandals,
until the letters received from her husband, accusing her
of errors of which she was guiltless, stabbed her to the
heart. Her appeals against these injurious aspersions
were in accordance with her own noble nature. We can
only quote a few lines from her letter to Napoleon:—</p>

<p>“Can it be possible, my friend? Is the letter indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
yours which I have just received? Scarcely can I give it
credence, on comparing the present with those now before
me, and to which your love gave so many charms! My
eyes cannot doubt that those pages which rend my heart
are too surely yours; but my soul refuses to admit that
yours could have dictated those lines, which to the ardent
joy experienced on hearing from you have caused to succeed
the mortal grief of reading the expressions of a displeasure,
the more afflicting to me that it must have
proved a source of fearful pain to you.</p>

<p>“I am entirely ignorant in what I have offended, to
create an enemy so determined to ruin my repose by interrupting
yours; but surely it must be a great reason
which can thus induce some one unceasingly to renew
against me calumnies of such a specious nature as to be
admitted, even for a moment, by one who hitherto has
deemed me worthy of his entire affection and confidence.</p>

<p>“Oh, my friend! in place of lending an ear to impostors,
who, from motives which I cannot explain, seek
to ruin our happiness, why do you not rather reduce them
to silence by the recital of your benefits to a woman
whose character has never incurred the suspicion of ingratitude?
On hearing what you have done for me and
for my children, my traducers would be silent. Your
conduct, admired as it has been throughout the whole of
Europe, has in my heart but awakened deeper adoration
of the husband who made choice of me, poor as I was,
and unhappy. Every step which you take adds to the
splendor of the name I bear—and is such a moment
seized to persuade you that I no longer love you? What
absurdity, or rather what vileness, on the part of your
companions, jealous as they are of your marked superiority!
I tremble when I think of the dangers which surround<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
you. God knows when or where this letter may
reach you. May it restore to you a repose which you
ought never to have foregone, and more than ever give you
an assurance, that while I live you will be dear to me as on
the day of our last separation. Farewell, my only friend!
Confide in me, love me, and receive a thousand tender
caresses.”</p>

<p>This touching letter, from which we have only quoted a
few lines, was probably not received by Bonaparte until
after his return to France. And Napoleon returning to
Paris found Josephine absent, for she had started to meet
him in wild impatience to welcome him; but missing him
on the road, he arrived home first and found his house
deserted: but his mother, sisters, and sisters-in-law, and
in short every member of his family, except Louis, who
had attended Madame Bonaparte to Lyons, came to him
immediately, and insinuated the basest scandals about his
devoted wife, who was only absent because she had flown
to meet him. But the impression made upon him by his
deserted home and the false accusations of his family
were profound and terrible; and nine years afterwards,
when the tie between himself and Josephine was broken,
he showed that he had not forgotten that time. From not
finding his wife with his family, he inferred that she felt
herself unworthy of his presence and feared to meet the
man she had wronged; and he considered her journey to
Lyons a mere pretence,—so cruelly had these evil slanderers
blackened her lovely and devoted character. After
the reconciliation which followed, Bonaparte seemed for
a time to have forgotten these evil lies; but his family
were intensely chagrined.</p>

<p>Madame Pauline Le Clerc was most vexed at the pardon
which Napoleon had granted his wife. Bonaparte’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
mother was also very ill-pleased, for she had never liked
Josephine. Madame Bacchiocchi gave free vent to her
ill-humor and disdain, and Bonaparte’s brothers were at
open war with Josephine. No wonder that with such a
host of evil-minded, envious relations, poor Josephine was
most terribly maligned! Bonaparte’s brothers, desirous
of obtaining entire dominion over Napoleon, strenuously
endeavored to lessen the influence which Josephine possessed
over him.</p>

<p>Napoleon would probably have adhered to his first idea
of adopting Eugène de Beauharnais as his successor, had it
not been for his own family, all eager for wealth and
honors, all jealous of any favors shown to Josephine or
her children, all of them constantly urging a divorce.</p>

<p>“Divorce her at once,” Joseph Bonaparte exclaimed;
“you are not married to her. The woman may die, and
it will then be said you have poisoned her,—that you
found it to your interest to do so.”</p>

<p>Napoleon was staggered at these monstrous suggestions.
His countenance became of a deathlike paleness as these
terrible insinuations fell upon his ear. After a moment or
two of silence he murmured:—</p>

<p>“You have forced on me an idea which would never
have occurred to me, and with it the possibility of a
divorce.”</p>

<p>Thus was the evil working, which should end in the cruel
blow to Josephine and the downfall of Napoleon. Years
elapsed before Napoleon was induced to act upon these
suggestions, but the tempters had begun their diabolical
work.</p>

<p>As Napoleon’s marriage with Josephine had at first
been only a civil ceremony,—the religious service having
been only performed at the time of the coronation, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
religious worship had been reinstated in France,—Joseph
Bonaparte basely insinuated that the tie between them was
not binding; and as by some mistake the necessary
witnesses had not been present at the after religious
ceremony, and a signature was said to be wanting to
make the certificate of marriage complete, these circumstances
were afterwards laid stress upon, in declaring that
their marriage had been irregular and could therefore be
annulled. And either by evil intent or inadvertence a
notice of the religious ceremony did not appear in the
<i>Moniteur</i>, which described the coronation at great
length. Thus was the web spun by the political spiders
closer and closer around their poor innocent victim, Josephine,
and she became the subject of their vilest plots.</p>

<p>Napoleon’s attachment to Josephine withstood all suggestions
during the period preceding the Empire, and Josephine
herself afterwards declared, “that unless urged by
others, he would not of himself have thought of a separation.”</p>

<p>But at length, instigated by Fouché and his own relations
and other evil advisers, Napoleon determined to
divorce Josephine. This same wily Fouché hinted to Josephine
her coming doom, and advised that she should first
broach the subject to the emperor; but Josephine indignantly
refused.</p>

<p>“It was on Sunday, on returning from church, that
Fouché, the minister of the police, leading Josephine to the
embrasure of a window in the château at Fontainebleau,
gave her the first shock on the subject of the divorce,
which did not take place until two years after.”</p>

<p>The family of Bonaparte became more openly hostile to
Josephine. One of the writers of her memoirs says:—</p>

<p>“Joseph could not endure her, while on the other hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
his wife rendered her the fullest justice. As to Madame
Murat, she was by no means careful to conceal her thoughts,
and on many occasions sought to humiliate Napoleon’s
wife. Madame Bacchiocchi, Napoleon’s eldest sister, considered
Josephine as the earliest instrument of her brother’s
greatness. ‘But,’ said she, ‘the moment her power
becomes too great it must be broken down, and that without
pity.’ She was one of the first to advise that unrighteous
separation, which worked so much prejudice to
the emperor and his whole family. Madame Letitia,
Napoleon’s mother, occasioned real trouble and vexation
to her daughter-in-law. Their feelings were in perpetual
opposition. The one was remarkable for her acts of
benevolence; the other for her extreme parsimony. The
mother loudly disapproved of the luxury which reigned at
her son’s court, and charged the fault to Josephine.”</p>

<p>When Joseph Bonaparte became king of Naples, his
sister Caroline, then Grand Duchess of Berg, avoided as
much as possible her modest sister-in-law, the queen of
Naples. But finding herself obliged to give her the title
of “Your Majesty,” she dared at length to complain to
Napoleon that he had not yet given her a crown. Napoleon
replied: “Your complaint astonishes me, madame!
To hear you, one might suppose I had deprived you of
your right of succession to the throne of your <i>ancestor</i>.”</p>

<p>No one of Napoleon’s evil advisers was more crafty,
insidious, and unscrupulous than Fouché. Like a Mephistopheles,
with sardonic smile he held his fingers on
the keys which played the tune of politics. Through his
minions, the police, he entered even the closed doors of
his Majesty’s cabinet, and caught the rumors which
dropped in idle gossip from the rosy lips of the beauties
of the court.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[418]</a></span></p>

<p>After his cool affront to Josephine, in endeavoring to
persuade her that she should herself suggest to Napoleon
the divorce, she begged the emperor to remove Fouché
from his office of minister of police; but Bonaparte, with
strange blindness, kept the wily serpent near him, and
banished from his presence his own guardian angel. And
when at last he had been stung himself by the treacherous
fangs of the insidious viper, and Napoleon became at
length convinced that Fouché was maintaining a correspondence
with England, through his spies, the emperor
dismissed him; but it was too late.</p>

<p>The same Fouché who had thrust the dagger into the
heart of Josephine, afterwards proved to be one of the
chief instigators of the plots which caused the second abdication
of Napoleon. Bourrienne thus pithily describes
him:—</p>

<p>“Fouché had opinions, but he belonged to no party;
and his political success is explained by the readiness
with which he always served the party he knew must triumph,
and which he himself overthrew in its turn. He
maintained himself in favor, from the days of blood and
terror until the time of the second restoration, only by
abandoning and sacrificing those who were attached to
him. In all things he looked only to himself; and to this
egotism he sacrificed both subjects and governments.</p>

<p>“Such were the secret causes of the sway exercised by
Fouché during the Convention, the Directory, the Empire,
and after the return of the Bourbons. He helped to
found and to destroy every one of these successive
governments.”</p>

<p>Napoleon afterwards realized some of the treachery of
this archtraitor, and thus spoke of him at St. Helena:—</p>

<p>“Fouché is a miscreant of all colors;—a priest, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
Terrorist, and one who took an active part in many bloody
scenes of the Revolution. He is a man who can worm all
your secrets out of you with an air of calmness and of
unconcern.”</p>

<p>What wonder that poor unsuspicious Josephine was betrayed
by such a Judas!</p>

<p>This smiling Mephistopheles might thus have counselled
with his crafty soul:—</p>

<p>“And so her Majesty beseeches that I be dismissed!
We’ll see, my lady, whether you or I shall conquer in
this contest! You think you hold your husband’s heart;
but I hold the ear of his proud ambition. Which, think
you, will prevail? You are surrounded by his relations,
who hate you with envious and jealous hatred, than which
there is none more bitter. I am their confidant. Ha!
methinks my cards in hand shall win the game, even
against the <i>Queen of Hearts!</i>”</p>

<p>Bourrienne relates the following conversation with
Fouché, which bears upon this point:—</p>

<p>“I said a few words to him about Bonaparte’s regret
at not having children. My object was to learn Fouché’s
opinion on this subject; and it was not without a feeling
of indignation I heard him say, ‘It is to be hoped the
empress will soon die. Her death will remove many difficulties.
Sooner or later he must take a wife who will
bear him a child; for as long as he has no direct heir,
there is every chance that his death will be the signal for
a revolution. His brothers are perfectly incapable of
filling his place, and a new party would rise up in favor
of the Bourbons, which must be prevented above all
things.’”</p>

<p>And yet this same Fouché afterwards intrigued for the
return of the Bourbons.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span></p>

<p>Just before Napoleon signed his second abdication, a
provisional government was established with Fouché at
the head. This crafty schemer was at that time the agent
of Louis XVIII. and of the Duke of Wellington; and so
it was Fouché, who, as a leader in the Chamber of Deputies,
forced Napoleon to sign the second abdication. The
Marquis de Bonnay wrote concerning his intrigues:—</p>

<p>“I know for a certainty that M. de M., who was sent
to Vienna by Fouché, has taken part in a dialogue to the
following effect:—</p>

<p>“‘Do not go to war with us, and we will rid you of that
man.’</p>

<p>“‘Well, then; rid us of him at once.’</p>

<p>“‘Would you like the king of Rome, or a regency?’</p>

<p>“‘No!’</p>

<p>“‘The Duke of Orleans?’</p>

<p>“‘No!’</p>

<p>“‘Well, Louis XVIII.?—since it must be so. But no
nobility, no priestcraft, and above all, no Blacas.’</p>

<p>“‘Begin by ridding us of Bonaparte and all his race.’”</p>

<p>And rid them of Bonaparte, Fouché did; and again
this wily diplomat, or base traitor,—according as the
reader sides with one or the other party,—came once
more to the front, and received again the office of minister
of police under Louis XVIII. Thus Fouché had played
his cards and won, and Josephine and Napoleon had
lost. Surely the title which Lanfrey applies to Napoleon
would most fittingly describe Fouché,—“<i>an incorrigible
gambler</i>.”</p>

<p>During their private conferences, previous to the direct
announcement of his determination, Napoleon endeavored
to persuade Josephine of the political necessity of a separation;
veiling his real intentions, so that they should appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
only hints of the measure. Sometimes these vague
hints would be met by Josephine with tears and supplications;
at other times she would rise in calm dignity and
defend her claims with unanswerable facts and predictions.
There are several most interesting accounts given
of various conversations between them at different times,
before the final announcement. The following is perhaps
the most impressive.</p>

<p>On one occasion Josephine dared predict to him, that
the day he separated himself from her his bright star of
destiny should fade, and that their parting hour would be
the beginning of his downfall.</p>

<p>“You need,” she said, “a friend, and you have nothing
but flatterers. Do you believe that your generals are
truly attached to you? No! the most of them only wait
a propitious moment to turn their arms against you. Do
you think they will, with unconcern, see the Emperor
Napoleon searching for a wife among the daughters of
kings? No! they have been bred in the same school as
yourself; they have <i>earned true nobility</i>, at the price of
their blood; and the blazonry upon their armor, of which
they are so justly proud, is but the evidence of valor
which has given them the prodigious power they now
enjoy in Europe.</p>

<p>“But remember! in you they but behold their equal.
If they sustain the glory of your throne, it is only because
your elevation seems their work. They believe you great,
because the rays of your grandeur are reflected by themselves.
If they burn incense to you, they breathe with
delight the incense of a power which they share. But the
moment a foreign wife shall come and seat herself at
your side, the court will cease to be directed by the same
influence. You are too <i>new</i> a man to attach to your person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
the ancient families. You may load them with favors;
you have it in your power, and it is your duty to make
them forget the wrongs inseparable from the Revolution.
But beware you do not humble the old generals who
served their country before you. Banish from your halls
that too severe etiquette which was not made for them.
Their wives and children ought not to be made to blush,
either in your presence or in that of your future companion.
The sword of the brave will ever be your surest
safeguard. I myself have ever been careful to conciliate
all parties, and to be indulgent to all opinions; so much
so, that, since your fortunes have become so wonderful,
I have in a manner taught your officers to forget the immense
distance which exists between General Bonaparte
and the Emperor Napoleon.”</p>

<p>Some days before the divorce, Josephine is reported to
have thus addressed Napoleon:—</p>

<p>“Bonaparte, even now you have no confidence in the
stability of your power. You want an ally; and the
very sovereign whom you have lately vanquished, the
sovereign who has just grounds to hate you, sees himself
flattered by the very man who has so lately overrun his
country. If such an enormous sacrifice as the giving his
daughter to you in marriage be necessary to give peace
to his subjects, you cannot but know that he will secretly
despise you, and say to himself:—</p>

<p>“‘The man who so lately made me tremble, who imposed
such cruel conditions upon me, is on the eve of
some dreadful catastrophe. Did he suppose himself
firmly seated upon his throne, he would not need to resort
to a foreign alliance; and the very circumstance that the
mighty conqueror is so anxious to obtain a companion of
illustrious birth, is evidence that he intends, should a
storm ever arise, to lean upon that foreign support.’”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span></p>

<p>It was indeed strange that the cry of the Revolution,
“Down with the <i>Autrichienne!</i>” did not warn Napoleon
that it would be an impolitic action to place another Austrian
woman upon the throne of France.</p>

<p>The Empress Josephine, after having long dreaded the
terrible misfortune which at length overwhelmed her, was
totally unprepared for the shock when it fell. She had
for a time been lulled into a fancied security, and had
regained tranquillity just as the blow came. Nothing had
been done to prepare her for it. Even when all Europe
was talking of this probable event, and after negotiations
had been entered into regarding her successor, still no
direct word had been spoken to the poor victim of this
atrocious cruelty and perfidious crime.</p>

<p>The letter in which Napoleon told her of his approaching
arrival at Fontainebleau still exists. Its tone is particularly
affectionate; and he thus wrote: “<i>I am feasting
on the thought of seeing thee again;</i>—I embrace thee.
Ever thine.” These were his words sent from Nymphenburg,
Oct. 21, 1809. When he arrived at Fontainebleau,
however, Josephine perceived that he was constrained
and cold, which alarmed her; and the triumphant airs of
her sworn enemies, his sisters and brothers and mother,
who hastened to greet him with officious homage, betokened
that some new effront would soon be offered her.</p>

<p>While she was obliged to conceal beneath a smiling
countenance her consuming anxieties, in the midst of the
brilliant <i>fêtes</i> of the court, she found that the communication
between her suite of apartments and those of the
emperor had been closed by his orders, which announced
to her that her dreaded doom was nigh.</p>

<p>The Duchesse D’Abrantes gives this account of a visit
to Josephine just previous to the public announcement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
the divorce: “I had an interview with the empress at
Malmaison. I had sent her a plant from the Pyrenees,
and she wished me to see it in the hot-house. But in vain
she attempted to employ herself with those objects which
pleased her the most; her eyes were frequently suffused
with tears; she was pale, and her whole manner marked
indisposition. ‘It is very cold!’ she said, drawing her
shawl about her; but, alas! it was the chill of grief creeping
about her heart, like the cold hand of death. ‘Madame
Junot,’ she said, ‘remember what I say to you this day
here, in this hot-house,—this place which is now a paradise,
but which may soon become a desert to me,—remember
that this separation will be my death, and it is they
who will have killed me! I shall be driven in disgrace
from him who has given me a crown! Yet God is my
witness that I love him more than my life, and much more
than that throne, that crown, which he has given me.’
The empress may have appeared more beautiful, but never
more attractive than at that moment. If Napoleon had
seen her then, surely he could never have divorced her.”
Lanfrey thus comments upon this event: “On the
evening of Nov. 30, the prefect of the palace was
on duty in an apartment adjoining the drawing-room
where the emperor and Josephine were sitting, when he
heard piercing cries, and with amazement recognized the
voice of the empress. A few moments afterwards the
door opened, and Napoleon having called him in, he
beheld the empress suffering from a violent nervous attack,
and uttering exclamations of distress and despair.
He then helped Napoleon to carry her into her own apartment.
In fact, the much-dreaded explosion had taken
place. The emperor had at first determined to await the
arrival of the Prince Eugène in Paris, in order that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
presence and consolations of the son whom Josephine so
tenderly loved might soften the bitterness of his intended
communication. When he announced the terrible news to
her who alone was ignorant of it,—to the woman who, by
having brought him among her wedding presents the chief
command of the army in Italy, had so eminently contributed
towards his exalted fortune,—eight days had already
elapsed since he had desired Champagny to ask for him
the hand of the Emperor Alexander’s sister. It was Russia,
his ally, not Austria, whom he thought it better to
address first.</p>

<p>“As the sad scene which had revealed the domestic
trouble in the imperial family was soon publicly known,
the divorce became the subject of conversation at the
court and throughout the nation. The unfortunate
Josephine was supported, it is true, by the affection of
her children, who felt the blow scarcely less keenly than
herself; but being convinced of the absolute futility of
resistance, she had, after the deepest anguish, submitted,
rather than resigned herself to that strong will which
henceforward became inflexible.</p>

<p>“In order to feign consent, it was necessary that she
should show herself in public. Hence she was dragged
about to all the grand official receptions, and the scandal-loving
public watched her closely, in order to note the extent
and progress of her misfortune. The echoes of the
palace more than once repeated her sobs and complaints;
but it was desirable that this victim of pride and policy
should appear content to sacrifice herself, and she was
not allowed the satisfaction even of a display of grief.
In the <i>fêtes</i> given at the commencement of December, to
celebrate the anniversary of the coronation, Paris beheld
her, with death in her heart and a smile on her lips, bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
the despair which was a torture to her, with grace
playing her part of sovereign for the last time; surrounded
by her children, who, to use the expression of a contemporary,
were dancing at their mother’s funeral.”</p>

<p>Upon his arrival in Paris, after the blow had fallen
upon poor Josephine, Prince Eugène had a mournful interview
with his afflicted mother.</p>

<p>“’Tis not,” said that noble woman in the agony of her
heart, “’tis not that I regret the throne, my son, but I
feel that I am leaving the emperor a prey to the evil-minded
men who seek his ruin. I shall be no longer here
to warn him against their false-hearted counsels. The
task reserved for me henceforth will be to pity him, and
to pray for him and the French people whom I love. <i>My
children will imitate my example.</i>”</p>

<p>Bourrienne gives the following words of Josephine, regarding
her divorce:—</p>

<p>“I was ushered into the drawing-room at Malmaison,
where I found Josephine and Hortense. When I entered,
Josephine stretched out her hand to me, saying, ‘Ah,
my friend!’ These words she pronounced with deep
emotion, and tears prevented her from continuing. She
threw herself on the ottoman on the left of the fireplace,
and beckoned me to sit down beside her. Hortense stood
by the fireplace, endeavoring to conceal her tears. After
a struggle to overcome her feelings, Josephine said:—</p>

<p>“‘I have drained my cup of misery. He has cast me
off!—forsaken me! He conferred upon me the vain
title of empress only to render my fall the more marked.
Ah! I knew the destiny that awaited me; for what would
he not sacrifice to his ambition!’ As she finished these
words, one of Queen Hortense’s ladies entered with a
message to her; Hortense withdrew, so that I was left
alone with Josephine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span></p>

<p>“She seemed to wish for the relief of disclosing her
sorrows. Josephine confirmed what Duroc had told me
respecting the two apartments at Fontainebleau; then,
coming to the period when Bonaparte had declared to her
the necessity of a separation, she said:—</p>

<p>“‘My dear Bourrienne, during all the years you were
with us you know I made you the confidant of my
thoughts, and kept you acquainted with my sad forebodings.
They are now cruelly fulfilled. I acted the
part of a good wife to the very last. I have suffered all,
and I am resigned!</p>

<p>“‘What fortitude did it require latterly to endure my
situation, when, though no longer his wife, I was obliged
to seem so in the eyes of the world! With what eyes do
courtiers look upon a repudiated wife! I was in a state
of vague uncertainty worse than death, until the fatal
day when he at length avowed to me what I had long
before read in his looks!</p>

<p>“‘On the 30th of November, 1809, we were dining
together as usual. I had not uttered a word during that
sad dinner, and he had broken silence only to ask one of
the servants what it was o’clock. As soon as Bonaparte
had taken his coffee, he dismissed all the attendants, and
I remained alone with him. I saw in the expression of
his countenance what was passing in his mind, and I
knew that my hour was come.</p>

<p>“‘He stepped up to me,—he was trembling, and I
shuddered; he took my hand, pressed it to his heart, and
after gazing at me a few moments in silence, he uttered
these fatal words:—</p>

<p>“‘“Josephine! my dear Josephine! You know how
I have loved you!... To you, to you alone, I owe the
only moments of happiness I have tasted in this world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
But, Josephine, my destiny is not to be controlled by my
will. My dearest affections must yield to the interests of
France.”</p>

<p>“‘“Say no more!” I exclaimed, “I understand you:
I expected this; but the blow is not the less mortal.”</p>

<p>“‘I could not say another word,’ continued Josephine.
‘I know not what happened after. I seemed to lose my
reason; I became insensible, and when I recovered I
found myself in my chamber. Your friend Corvisart and
my poor daughter were with me. Bonaparte came to see
me in the evening; and oh! Bourrienne, how can I describe
to you what I felt at sight of him! even the interest
he evinced for me seemed an additional cruelty. Alas! I
had good reason to fear ever becoming an empress!’”</p>

<p>The 15th of December, 1809, was the fatal day appointed
for the consummation of the divorce. The imperial
council of state was convened, and the official
announcements of the coming separation were made.
Napoleon’s address on this occasion is well known. The
prepared response which Josephine attempted to read in
acceptation of this cruel decree, was too much for even
her marvellous fortitude to endure; and Eugène was
obliged to take the paper from his weeping mother, and
finish for her the heart-breaking avowal which her quivering
lips refused to utter.</p>

<p>Upon the following day the council was again assembled
with the imperial family in the grand <i>salon</i> at the
Tuileries, to witness the legal consummation of the
divorce.</p>

<p>All were in court costume. Napoleon entered the
apartment, clothed in the imposing robes of state. Pale
as a corpse, he stood leaning against a pillar, with folded
arms, motionless as a statue.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span></p>

<p>Again the poor victim of this cruel sacrifice must appear.
The keen-edged knife of the political guillotine of
blind ambition must this day perform its final act of
political decapitation.</p>

<p>The door opens; a sad figure appears. Some reports
clothe this sorrowful, weeping woman in white muslin;
others in black satin. As the latter seems more fitting: to
this funereal scene, we incline to that supposition, which
would surely appear more appropriate than bridal white
for this moment of public repudiation.</p>

<p>The graceful woman, bending like a weeping-willow
before the storm of sorrow which is crushing her to the
earth, walks slowly to the seat prepared for her, followed
by her son and daughter. The pallor of death is upon her
brow. A coffin would have seemed less cruel than the
mocking chair of state waiting for her. Had she been
Marie Antoinette upon the scaffold, she could scarcely
have suffered more; for Marie Antoinette could at least
love her dead husband without reproach; while the living
husband of poor Josephine holds in his hand the cruel
dagger which is piercing her bleeding heart, and his
word tears from her brow her rightful royal diadem of
wifehood.</p>

<p>The iniquitous decree is read. The quivering victim
must pronounce her own sentence. Pressing her handkerchief
to her streaming eyes for a moment, she slowly
rises, and the oath of acceptance passes her pallid lips.
The pen is handed to her, and she signs her own <i>death-warrant;</i>
and then glides like a mournful spectre from
the grand <i>salon</i> of state, the imperial grandeur of which,
together with the presence of her triumphant foes, mock
her unutterable woe.</p>

<p>It is the evening of the same day. The weeping woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
has still another heart-rending duty to perform. She must
take her final farewell of the man who has stabbed her to
the heart; of the husband whom she still adores with
every heart-beat of her loyal, loving soul; of the emperor
who has crowned her, only to tear from her brow his royal
gift and bestow it upon another. Was ever woman’s soul
torn with such conflicting emotions? Pride and love have
fought a terrible battle within her heart, since the cruel
public sacrifice of the morning. But love has conquered;
yes, so royally conquered, that there is no place left in
her soul for aught but overpowering devotion to the adored
husband of her heart.</p>

<p>Napoleon had retired to his apartments. His valet was
about to be dismissed for the night when the door opens,
and upon the threshold stands Josephine!—more irresistible
in her infinite sorrow than in her most imperial robes
of dazzling splendor. Her tender eyes are glistening
through her tears; her hair falls in disordered locks around
her quivering face; her hands are clasped in agonizing
despair. For one moment she gazes upon the face of him
who has been her life and happiness;—then, forgetting
all but her overpowering love, she throws herself into his
arms, exclaiming, in tones of commingled tenderness and
heart-broken anguish,—“My husband!—My husband!”</p>

<p>Napoleon was overpowered at last. With streaming
eyes he beckoned to his valet to retire, and the husband and
wife were left alone for their last sad interview. When
an hour afterwards Josephine retired from the apartment,
still sobbing with irresistible emotion, the valet entered to
remove the lights, and found Napoleon with face buried
in the pillow and form convulsed with choking sobs.</p>

<p>The next morning, at eleven o’clock, Josephine was to
bid a last adieu to the Tuileries. At the appointed hour she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
appeared, heavily veiled and leaning upon the arm of one
of her lady attendants. Silently she walked through the
spacious halls, where all the household had assembled to
take final leave of their loved mistress. Not a word was
spoken; and as Josephine entered the close carriage she
waved an adieu to the weeping friends around her, and
without another glance at the grand palace which had
witnessed her proud happiness and unutterable woe, she
was driven rapidly to her future sad retreat at Malmaison.</p>

<p>But the envious hate of the Bonaparte family received
its just reward on the occasion of the marriage of Napoleon
to Maria Louisa; and they were then obliged to
swallow a more bitter pill of mortified pride than any
which had been administered to them during the reign of
Josephine.</p>

<p><i>Madame Mère Bonaparte</i> and the queens of Holland
and Naples, the princesses Eliza and Pauline, and the
kings Louis and Jerome, were gathered to discuss the
coming marriage ceremony of the future empress. Murat,
the handsome king of Naples, entered, attired in his rich
gala dress of fawn-colored satin embroidered with silver,
and wearing a purple mantle lined with ermine and clasped
with jewels. The hilt and sheath of his sword sparkled
with gems, and his belt was covered with rubies. He
wore a sort of cap, of purple, surrounded by an open
crown of precious stones, while his boots were of purple
velvet edged with fur, and his knee-breeches and vest
were of white satin. As he entered the apartment, so
proud and so handsome, all of his family exclaimed:</p>

<p>“What a handsome dress!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I flatter myself!” said Murat, gazing into the
long mirror before which <i>la Princesse Borghèse</i> was paying
court to her own beauty; “but do you know, fair ladies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
that you are about to be disgraced in the eyes of all
Europe?” continued Murat, holding up a printed paper.</p>

<p>“What is it?” exclaimed all in a breath.</p>

<p>“Read!—<i>mesdames les reines!</i>” replied Murat,
“and you will learn that <i>all, queens as you are</i>, you will
to-morrow, in the chapel of the Louvre, during the marriage
ceremony, have the honor of bearing the train of the
imperial mantle of your august sister-in-law.”</p>

<p>“Napoleon can never request of us such an insulting
office,” said one.</p>

<p>“It is no <i>request</i>,” said Jerome, “the emperor <i>commands</i>
it.”</p>

<p>“As for me,” cried la <i>Princesse Borghèse</i>, “I would
like to see myself touch her odious mantle!”</p>

<p>“Do not excite yourself, sister,” said the queen of
Naples, “this matter does not concern either you or the
<i>grande duchesse;</i> you are neither of you <i>queens</i>.”</p>

<p>“But I am more than a <i>parvenue</i> queen,” gasped
Pauline, between her sobs, “my husband was a noble
from birth.”</p>

<p>“I, for one, will not officiate as the waiting-woman of
my sister-in-law,” said the queen of Naples haughtily.</p>

<p>“I could not venture to hint at such a degradation to
my wife,—the daughter of the king of Wurtemberg,”
declared Jerome.</p>

<p>“Sons and daughters, son-in-law and daughter-in-law,”
said <i>Madame Mère</i>, “bear in mind that Napoléoné is
accustomed to be obeyed. He is entirely wrong in this
matter; but if he is resolved, you will obey.”</p>

<p>“The others may do as they like; but not <i>I</i>, <i>Madame
Mère</i>” said the spoiled beauty, Pauline.</p>

<p>“<i>You</i>, like the rest,” replied Madame Bonaparte,
with decision.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span></p>

<p>At that moment the doors were thrown open, and the
usher announced, “The Emperor!”</p>

<p>It was in vain that Pauline tried to conceal her tears of
rage; or that the queen of Naples endeavored to smooth
her ruffled brow; or that Murat hastily sheathed his splendid
sword, which he had just drawn in mock defiance to
the imperial command.</p>

<p>“<i>Madame la Princesse Borghèse!</i> explain what all this
means,” said Napoleon, with severity.</p>

<p>“My sisters and I do not think it proper to carry the
mantle of your wife,” Pauline exclaimed defiantly.</p>

<p>“What! do you all refuse?” asked the emperor.</p>

<p>“I cannot disgrace my crown,” sobbed Caroline
Murat.</p>

<p>“I will not publicly outrage my unhappy mother!”
bravely said Hortense.</p>

<p>“And you, Eliza?” remarked Napoleon; “you probably
dread the reproaches of your husband. Ladies, what
did I owe to you when I was called upon to reign over
France? I have placed you all on such a giddy elevation
that it has turned your heads. I have bestowed upon
your husbands and yourselves kingdoms, principalities,
and splendid establishments; I have overwhelmed you
with wealth and honors. What are you without me?
Which of you could sustain yourself, if I did not stretch
out my hand to support you? Oh! so this is the tone
that you assume! Your thrones belong to you by feudal
right? Mark me, ladies; the archchancellor of state
shall make to you, or rather to your husbands, an official
declaration; and whichever one among you ventures to
disobey my commands, shall be considered as a culprit,
and shall be put under the ban of the empire. And as
regards you, Madame Borghèse, who honor us by your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
alliance, as soon as the marriage <i>fêtes</i> have terminated
you will leave Paris; and as you first gave the signal of
resistance, so you shall be the first to obey. It is my
express determination that the empress, archduchess of
Austria, shall receive all the homage due to her birth and
rank.”</p>

<p>The emperor then haughtily withdrew. The poor Princess
Borghèse fell upon the floor in violent hysterics; and
Napoleon, having been apprised of the fact, sent his physician
to attend her, bearing also the information to her,
that it was the <i>command</i> of the emperor that she should
be perfectly recovered before the next day. So Pauline
could not feign sickness, and was obliged to resign herself
to her fate. But even Napoleon himself could not conquer
women’s tears; and although his unwilling relations
were forced to obey his imperial command, that fatal
train of the empress, measuring twelve yards in length,
was borne by weeping queens and princesses, who did
not even try to conceal their tears of mortification; and
they doubtless then realized that an empress of <i>royal
birth</i> was not after all such a desirable acquisition to
their family as they had supposed. If poor Josephine
had not been too generous to be spiteful, and too sad to
note aught but her own humiliation and woe, she might
have felt herself somewhat avenged by her unconscious
successor. As the gorgeous spectacle passed through the
magnificent gallery which connected the Tuileries with the
Louvre, a child exclaimed to its mother:—</p>

<p>“Mamma, why does the queen of Holland cry? I
thought queens were always laughing.”</p>

<p>Poor Hortense! It was indeed cruel in the extreme,
that she should have been forced to bear the mantle
of the woman who was so unjustly supplanting her own
mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span></p>

<p>Whenever Josephine’s friends conversed in her presence
regarding the woman who had taken her place, she
was careful to avoid the slightest remark which could be
construed into a censure of Maria Louisa, though her
sorrow could not be concealed. “He will never love
her,” she exclaimed with deep feeling; “he has sacrificed
everything to his politics; but his first wife—yes, his
first wife, will forever possess his confidence.” And she
did not deceive herself in this belief, for the ex-empress
had reason upon many occasions to exult in the irresistible
ascendency she still exercised over Napoleon.</p>

<p>On hearing of the birth of the king of Rome, Josephine
evinced her generous sympathy by making a present to
the baby archduke of a little carriage drawn by two
superb <i>merinos</i>. The emperor was much pleased with
this kind attention, but when he spoke of it to Maria
Louisa, the Austrian was offended; for she could never
endure to hear a word of praise regarding the woman who
had preceded her, and she always tried to prevent Napoleon’s
visits to his former wife. But the emperor never
ceased to honor Josephine by frequent letters, hurried
visits, and constant delicate attentions. Josephine was
never forgotten by him, and he always spoke of her with
new and increasing interest. He was displeased with
certain of his courtiers who affected to forget the forsaken
Josephine. “Have you been to Malmaison?”
he would inquire of them. “How does the empress?”
and these fickle courtiers perceived that if they would
please the emperor, they must pay their respects to Josephine.
Often when returning from a hunt, Napoleon
would go and surprise Josephine at Malmaison with a visit,
and walk with her in the garden, conversing with the
greatest interest about all his affairs; she was still his most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[436]</a></span>
intimate confidant. To Josephine alone could he confide
his inmost thoughts, sure of never being betrayed,
and always receiving her most devoted interest. The
emperor would often send word to the grand <i>écuyer</i> to
detain the Empress Maria Louisa at the riding-school;
and then took advantage of the moment of liberty to go
and surprise Josephine at Malmaison. It is said that
Napoleon was much displeased with Madame de la R.,
because, having been in Josephine’s service, she proposed
to fulfil the same duties for the Empress Maria Louisa.
“No,” said he with indignation; “she shall not. Although
I am charged with ingratitude towards my wife,
I will have no imitators, especially among the persons
whom she has honored with her confidence and loaded with
her favors.”</p>

<p>After her divorce, Josephine passed her time alternately
at Malmaison and the château of Navarre. She here dispensed
daily bounty to multitudes of poor families, who
were the recipients of her generous benevolence and the
objects of her personal care. The following touching incident
is said to have occurred just before Napoleon set
out on his fatal campaign to Russia.</p>

<p>The Empress Josephine was seated in her gallery of
paintings, when the emperor came upon her unawares,
and found her reading that passage in the life of Diocletian
relating to his abdication: “O ye, who have seen me
seated on a throne, come now and see the lettuce which I
have planted with my own hands!” Napoleon appeared
to be singularly impressed by these words, and said to
Josephine with unusual tenderness: “My wife” (for so
he continued to call her), “I shall, perhaps, terminate
my course in the same way, and take pride in showing
the beautiful fruits of your gardens, cultivated by my own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[437]</a></span>
hands, to the envoys of the different nations who may
come to visit Napoleon the <i>Philosopher</i>.”</p>

<p>“So much the better,” answered Josephine; “then
should we be happy indeed.” But soon her eyes filled
with tears, and she said with inexpressible sadness: “My
friend, you have a new wife and a son; I desire henceforth
only to aid you by my counsels. But should you
ever be free, or should the blast of adversity ever deliver
you to your enemies, come, come, O Bonaparte, to my
cherished asylum!”</p>

<p>Josephine was very desirous to behold the young king
of Rome. Madame Montesquieu, by the order of the emperor,
went to Trianon with her august <i>élève</i>. Hither
Josephine went, and when she beheld the young prince,
she lavished her caresses upon his baby face, exclaiming
with streaming eyes: “I now pardon her freely for
the wrong she did me in coming to usurp my place. I am
now willing to overlook all my husband’s errors, and concern
myself solely about the happiness of a father.”</p>

<p>Napoleon’s overthrow was the result of political errors,
into which he was led by evil advisers. They were:—</p>

<p>“1. The unjust war in Spain; an almost insupportable
draught upon the blood and treasure of France, and
utterly unproductive of profit or glory.</p>

<p>“2. The divorce of his wife Josephine,—a matter of
cold-blooded calculation; a wrong determination as to the
results to arise from the respective positions of the objects
upon the political chessboard. It was discarding a <i>French
woman</i> for an <i>Austrian princess</i>. It offended France; it
shocked all hearts by an apparent indifference to the love
of a noble-minded, innocent, faithful, and beautiful woman.</p>

<p>“3. The unfortunate campaign to Russia, an effort
which France was not then strong enough to sustain;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
though it was one of the grandest displays of military
power in the history of the world.”</p>

<p>And yet, with all Napoleon’s plans, it was not <i>his</i> son
who afterwards sat upon the French throne, but the <i>grandson</i>
of <i>Josephine</i>,—the son of Hortense and Louis Bonaparte
who subsequently reigned over France as Emperor
Napoleon III. What had the cruel and iniquitous divorce
availed after all? Thus a wise Providence seems to
declare to the sons of men through the sequences resulting
from such historical events, <i>Ye shall not do evil, presuming
to imagine that thereby good may arise!</i></p>

<p>Napoleon’s unfortunate and unjust war with Spain
proved in the end to have been an enterprise regarding
which the keen intuitions of Josephine had not deceived
her. She was endowed with an instinct so perfect, which
enabled her to foresee the future with such marvellous
skill, that it amounted with her almost to a gift of genius;
and she was seldom deceived respecting the good or evil
tendency of any of Napoleon’s measures. When informed
that the emperor intended to place Joseph Bonaparte upon
the throne of Spain, she declared that “she was seized
with a feeling of indescribable alarm.”</p>

<p>“When Bonaparte separated from Josephine, he left
the woman who had exercised a great influence upon his
destinies. It was she who had in a manner launched him
upon fortune’s car, who knew how to uphold him in spite
of envy, who was the guardian angel sent by Providence
upon the earth to repair a thousand wrongs; and from
the moment he repudiated her, Napoleon, the invincible
Napoleon, began to be a prey to fearful forebodings.
This false step was a triumph to his enemies, and all
Europe was amazed that a man whose former achievements
had covered him with glory, should thus, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[439]</a></span>
sort of ostentation, run after the daughter of a sovereign
whom he had subdued by force of arms. ‘From that
moment’ (such was the general exclamation) ‘that Napoleon
shall start this scandalous project of a divorce,
and, not content with severing the bonds which are for
him not less sacred than advantageous, shall dare aspire
to the hand of the august daughter of the Cæsars, Napoleon
is no longer anything of himself; he is but an ambitious
man. He will tremble for the result of the part he
is acting, for he will seek to sustain himself by force and
not by popular favor.’”</p>

<p>As the disasters of his last days gathered around Napoleon,
he said to Josephine on one occasion, when paying
her a visit at Malmaison:—</p>

<p>“Josephine, when my soul is filled with pain, I feel the
need of a true friend into whose bosom I may pour my
sorrows. What astonishes me is, that men should study
every other science except that of happiness. ’Tis only
in retirement that I have found it, and that I may, perhaps,
hereafter meet with it!”</p>

<p>Josephine said, regarding the taking of Paris by the
allied sovereigns:—</p>

<p>“My courtiers could not long conceal from me the
occupation of the capital. I found myself almost in the
sad condition of the family of Darius. Should I await
the orders of my husband’s conquerors, or should I go and
implore their generosity? The melancholy state to which
Bonaparte was reduced wholly engrossed my feelings
and my thoughts. I was resolved to share his death, or
to follow him into exile.”</p>

<p>“Noble-hearted woman! What a contrast does this
feeling present to that which actuated his second wife,
who abandoned him as readily and with as little compunction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
or concern, as though her child had been the son
of a German boor, and not of one as great as Cæsar or
Alexander!”</p>

<p>While Josephine was at Navarre, and anxiously awaiting
the next news from the captured city, she received
word from the minister Talleyrand, inviting her to return
to Malmaison, to meet there the Emperor Alexander and
the king of Prussia, who had expressed a wish to see the
queen of that palace of enchantments. Of her interview
with these sovereigns, Josephine says:—</p>

<p>“I thanked those magnanimous princes for having had
the generosity to honor with their presence the forsaken
wife of Bonaparte; I recommended to their kind consideration
that brave army which had long displayed such
prodigies of valor; I pleaded the cause of those brave
soldiers who still formed a bulwark around the hero of
Austerlitz; and I claimed, earnestly claimed, the liberty
of the man whom I still loved. I forgot all his wrongs
towards me, and thought only of his misfortunes.”</p>

<p>The Emperor Alexander of Russia said to Josephine:
“I congratulate you on having reigned over the French,
a nation so worthy to be well governed; I congratulate
you on having known how to make friends while on the
throne, friends who have followed you into retirement.
’Tis to you, madame, that France is in a great measure
indebted for the tranquillity she enjoyed during the first
years of your husband’s reign. Had Napoleon continued
to listen to your advice, he would probably now have
reigned over a great and generous people. All the sovereigns
in Europe, and myself the first, would ultimately
have applauded the wisdom of his institutions and the
strength of his government.”</p>

<p>When Napoleon returned from Elba to Paris, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
once more receiving the acclamations of his adherents at
the Tuileries, he is said to have fallen into a “melting
mood,” a few nights after his return thither, and he sent
for M. Horan, one of the physicians who had attended
Josephine in her last illness. After talking about his
former wife with much feeling, to whom he certainly was
attached even when he so cruelly abandoned her, he said
to the physician:—</p>

<p>“So, Monsieur Horan, you did not leave the empress
during her malady?”</p>

<p>“No, sire.”</p>

<p>“What was the cause of that malady?”</p>

<p>“Uneasiness of mind—grief.”</p>

<p>“You believe that?” and Napoleon laid a strong emphasis
on the word <i>believe</i>, looking steadfastly in the doctor’s
face. He then asked, “Was she long ill? Did
she suffer much?”</p>

<p>“She was ill a week, sire; her Majesty suffered little
pain.”</p>

<p>“Did she see that she was dying? Did she show
courage?”</p>

<p>“A sign her Majesty made when she could no longer
express herself, leaves me no doubt that she felt her end
approaching; she seemed to contemplate it without
fear.”</p>

<p>“Well!—well!” and then Napoleon, much affected,
drew close to M. Horan, and added, “You say that she
was in grief; from what did that arise?”</p>

<p>“From passing events, sire, from your Majesty’s position
last year.”</p>

<p>“Ah! she used to speak of me, then?”</p>

<p>“Often; very often.”</p>

<p>Here Napoleon drew his hand across his eyes, which
were filled with tears. He then said:—<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good woman! My excellent Josephine! She loved
me truly, did she not? Ah! she was a Frenchwoman!”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, sire! she loved you, and she would have
proved it, had it not been for dread of displeasing you;
she had conceived an idea.”</p>

<p>“How? What would she have done?”</p>

<p>“She one day said that as empress of the French she
would drive through Paris, with eight horses to her coach,
and all her household in gala livery, to go and rejoin you
at Fontainebleau, and never quit you more.”</p>

<p>“She would have done it! She was capable of doing
it!” exclaimed Napoleon, with deep emotion and eyes
full of tears; and then he asked the physician the most
minute questions about the last hours of Josephine: the
nature of her disease, the friends and attendants who
were around her at the hour of her death, and the conduct
of her two children Eugène and Hortense.</p>

<p>How different was Josephine’s fidelity to the man who
had even cut her to the heart by his cruel desertion when
he was at the height of his glory, but whom in his dire
misfortunes she did not cease to love and desire to aid,
from the cold apathy of the woman who had taken her
rightful place!</p>

<p>After the fall of the emperor, and his departure to the
island of Elba, Josephine fell into a profound melancholy.
For several days she preferred to remain alone. Her
ladies noticed that she often perused a letter which the
emperor had written to her from Brienne, in which he
said:—</p>

<p>“Josephine, while revisiting the spot where I passed
my early childhood, and comparing the peaceful hours I
then enjoyed with the agitations which I now experience,
I am constrained to say to myself, I fear death no longer—to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
me it would this day be a blessing,—<i>but I would once
more see Josephine</i>.”</p>

<p>Speaking of Napoleon at this time, she is reported to
have said: “I am the only one to whom he intrusted all
his secrets—all except the one which has caused his ruin;
and had he communicated that to me in season, I should
still have enjoyed his presence; and by means of my
counsels he would perhaps have escaped these new calamities.”</p>

<p>Among the last words uttered by the faithful Josephine,
were these, regarding Napoleon, whose loved portrait
she then gazed upon: “Banished to an island under a
foreign sky, torn from France, from a wife and a beloved
son, from all his friends; fallen from the palaces of kings,
among the hills of Elba, overcome by cares and fatigues,
sad and melancholy, alone amidst the dwellers upon that
island, there still remains to him one faithful Pylades,
and a few warriors who have voluntarily shared his exile.
Bonaparte can never find consolation in his deep misfortunes,
except in the reflection that there still remains to
him one true friend who hath never ceased to watch over
his precious life. But, alas! she is lost for him.”</p>

<p>“Josephine, Bonaparte’s last friend; Josephine, the
first object of his ambition, and the only woman whom he
truly loved. Bonaparte was fortunate while her lot was
connected with his. His after-life was less miserable
while she survived. Dying, she still wished to press his
hand; his name was the last word she uttered, and her
last tear fell upon his portrait.”</p>

<p>Time destroys great reputations, but that of Napoleon’s
first wife will be deathless while woman’s self-sacrificing
love remains.</p>

<p>“At least,” said Josephine, with dying breath; “at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
least I shall carry with me some regrets. I have aimed
at the good of the French people; I have done all in my
power to promote it, and I may say with truth to all who
attend me in my last moments, that never, no, never, did
the first wife of Napoleon Bonaparte cause a tear to
flow.”</p>

<p>Beautiful May had already clothed the gardens of
Malmaison with verdure and adorned them with radiant
flowers. The sunset tints crimsoned the western horizon,
and tipped the white clouds with purple and gold. The
birds in the groves were softly carolling their vesper
songs, and the gentle breeze, swaying the delicate leaves,
fanned with caressing touch the fevered cheek of the
dying Josephine, who, with eyes fast dimming in death,
gazed once more through the open window upon the
loved beauties of her favorite Malmaison, which on this
29th of May, 1814, seemed to have put on new loveliness
to comfort the gentle spirit so soon to take a fond and
last farewell. As the shadows of twilight deepened, and
the dying empress looked once more on the portrait of
her idolized husband, the emperor, she exclaimed, “<i>L’isle
d’Elbe——Napoleon!</i>” and closed her eyes on earth, and
passed beyond the portals of mortal life.</p>

<p>“The death of Josephine threw all France into tears,
and even strangers shared in the general sorrow. They
witnessed the universal regrets her death occasioned, and
it may be truly said, to the praise of both the friends and
foes of Bonaparte, that, on this mournful occasion, all
united to scatter flowers upon the tomb of the woman who
had adorned the happy days of the illustrious exile.”</p>

<p>On the 2d of June, the funeral honors were paid to the
mortal remains of the Empress Josephine, in the parish
church at Ruel. Commissioners from the sovereigns of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
Russia and Prussia headed the procession, which proceeded
from Malmaison to Ruel. Many foreign princes,
marshals, generals, and officers of the French and allied
armies escorted the renowned remains.</p>

<p>The military consisted of Russian Hussars and the
National Guards of France. The chief mourners were
Prince Eugène, the Grand Duke of Baden, Marquis
de Beauharnais (brother-in-law), Count de Tascher
(nephew), Count de Beauharnais (cousin), and the
grandchildren of the deceased empress.</p>

<p>The funeral oration was pronounced by the Archbishop
of Tours, while the bishops of Evreux and Versailles
assisted in the religious ceremonies. The body
of the empress was enclosed in a leaden coffin, which
was afterwards placed in one of sycamore wood covered
with black cloth. The casket was deposited in a vault
in the church at Ruel, over which was raised a <i>chapelle
ardente</i> formed of funeral hangings; the altar, richly
decorated in the form of a tomb, and the altar-piece,
representing a cross, were surmounted by a canopy. On
the right was placed a statue of Immortality, on the left
that of Religion. A sepulchral lamp was suspended in
the middle of the <i>chapelle ardente</i>.</p>

<p>Queen Hortense, who had been conveyed to the church
before the funeral obsequies, knelt for a long time beside
the tomb, with her brother, after the other mourners had
left the church.</p>

<p>The spot is now marked by a monument of white marble,
representing the empress kneeling in her coronation
robes, and bears this simple and touching inscription:—</p>

<p class="center">
EUGÈNE AND HORTENSE TO JOSEPHINE.<br>
</p>

<p>The widow and the orphan went daily to weep by her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
tomb. Many of her faithful friends continued to make
visits to the last resting-place of her whose memory was
honored by universal respect and sincere mourning. The
poor and the rich alike honored her life and mourned her
death. “What now remains to Josephine is the recollection
of her good deeds,”—a more fitting memorial than
costly monument or marble sarcophagus of most elaborate
art.</p>

<p>As an empress, none can claim a more exalted place,
as the personification of grace, beauty, and queenly dignity.
But it is as a <i>woman</i>—as a <i>wife</i> and a <i>mother</i>—that
the brightest halo of glory crowns the pure brow of
Josephine; and as <i>Love’s Martyr</i>, she has gained the
highest place amongst the self-sacrificing women of historic
fame.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“EVERYTHING happens in France,” says La Rochefoucauld;
and indeed it would seem so. The history
of no other country of modern times presents such a
series of rapid changes, decided extremes, and strange incongruities.
Monarchies, empires, republics, follow each
other in rapid succession. Yet through it all—in base
servility or in fierce revolt, in licentiousness or prudery,
in anarchy or order, in despotism or demagogy; under
Valois, Bourbon, or Bonaparte; from Versailles and Louis
XIV. to Malmaison of the First, and Compiègne of the
Second Empire—we see the same thoughts, the same
ideas, the same traits of character, though veiled under
different garbs.</p>

<p>In 1685 the House of Bourbon was at the zenith of its
glory. France, crushed with oppression, bowed beneath
its yoke. One hundred and fifty thousand souls rioted in
luxury. Twenty-five millions toiled to administer to their
luxury. The people cried for bread, and proud, licentious
nobles bid them “eat grass,” while the monarch, from
his gilded palace, thundered forth his arbitrary dictum,
“<i>L’État c’est moi!</i>”</p>

<p>“The kingdom is in a deplorable state,” said Mirabeau.
“It can only be regenerated by some great internal convulsion.
But woe to those who live to see that. <i>The
French people do not do things by halves.</i>” The convulsion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
comes. The French people do not do things by halves.
The throne falls with a crash, and the guillotine stands in
the <i>Place de la Concorde</i>.</p>

<p>Then comes the Empire. Glory is the object sought,
and glory is attained. France is ablaze with glory.
Rivoli. Austerlitz. Waterloo! And the First Empire—with
its glories and its triumphs, its crowns and its sceptres,
its stars and its crosses—fades like a dream, and
is gone. The Bourbons return to the homes of their ancestors.
Again the storm arises, and the Republic is
proclaimed. The Republic becomes the Empire. Laurels,
crowns, triumph! Glory is sought, but ’tis pacific glory.
“The Empire is peace.” France prospers. But a dark
cloud gathers on the horizon. The thunder peals. War
rages fast and furious. Defeat, disaster, ruin! The
Empire has fallen to pieces! Bourbon and Bonaparte
wander through Europe.</p>

<p>’Tis the height of the Paris “season,” and with its
gayly dressed crowds and splendid equipages, the <i>Avenue
des Champs Élysées</i> wears a festive, smiling air. Bright
shines the sun, gilding with its rays the dome and turrets
of the Tuileries, the terraces and statues, the obelisk of
Luxor, and sending back the waters of the fountains in
showers of glittering diamonds, while far in the distance
the massive outline of the <i>Arc de Triomphe</i> looms lofty
against the clear blue sky. Carriages, horsemen, and
pedestrians, a countless throng, are on their way to and
from the <i>Bois de Boulogne;</i> but one alone attracts universal
attention. A tall and graceful figure clad in a
dark green habit, and above whose head there floats a
snow-white plume, she sits proud and erect upon her
splendid thoroughbred. Paris sees with admiration, and
in every mouth there is but one question, “Who is yonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
fair <i>equestrienne</i>, who sits so splendidly, who rides so
fearlessly?”</p>

<p>“Tis Eugénie de Montijo, Comtesse de Téba.”</p>

<p>Born in Spain in 1826, in the province of Granada, her
early days were passed among the picturesque scenery
with which the pen of Irving has made us familiar. Her
father, the Count de Montijo and Téba, was a grandee of
Spain, and from him she inherited many titles of nobility.
Washington Irving, who was then in Spain, knew her
mother, Maria Manuela Kirkpatrick, and was a frequent
visitor at her house, where he soon made friends with the
little Eugénie; and in later years, when she was dazzling
Europe with the costliness of her costumes and the splendor
of her court, he recalled with interest and amusement
the many times he had held upon his knee the future empress
of the French, “when she was an alert, dark-eyed
little girl, doubtless very happy to be entertained with
such stories of her native land as he could tell her.”</p>

<p>From Spain she was sent to Toulouse, and afterwards
to Bristol, to pursue her education; and when she left
school, beautiful and accomplished, easy in manners and
fluent in conversation,—which she could carry on with
apparently equal ease in Spanish, English, or in French,—possessing
more than average information, and displaying
a readiness and aptness of <i>repartee</i> approaching
the brilliancy of wit, with a beauty striking and exceptional,
a form slender and perfectly moulded, a complexion
brilliantly fair, and black eyes, large and expressive,
it is not surprising that she became successively
the belle of the season in London, Paris, and Madrid.</p>

<p>While in London she was introduced to Louis Napoleon,
then an exile from France, and distinguished chiefly for
the disastrous failure of his first attempt to overthrow the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
government of Louis Philippe. In 1851 she met him
again. He was then called <i>Napoleon III.</i>, and she was
regarded as one of the leaders of fashion in Paris. His
attentions to her gradually became marked and suggestive,
and finally he offered to share with her his throne. On
the 22d of January, 1853, the approaching nuptials were
announced publicly to the Senate. In this communication,
Napoleon thus expressed himself:—</p>

<p>“I come, then, gentlemen,” he said, “to announce that
I have preferred the woman whom I love and whom I
respect, to one who is unknown, and whose alliance would
have had advantages mingled with sacrifices. She who
has been the object of my preference is of princely descent.
French in heart, by education, and the recollection of the
blood shed by her father in the cause of the Empire, she
has, as a Spaniard, the advantage of not having in France
a family to whom it might be necessary to give honors
and fortune. Endowed with all the qualities of mind,
she will be the ornament of the throne. In the day of
danger she will be one of its courageous supporters. A
Catholic, she will address to Heaven the same prayers
with me for the happiness of France. In fine, by her
grace and her goodness, she will, I firmly hope, endeavor
to revive in the same position the virtues of the Empress
Josephine.”</p>

<p>On the 29th of January, the civil marriage of Louis
Napoleon with Mademoiselle de Montijo took place at the
Tuileries, and on the following day the religious ceremonies
were celebrated at the cathedral of Nôtre Dame. Never
had the arches of that venerable pile looked down upon a
more brilliant assemblage. The imperial couple sat on
two thrones erected in front of the high altar, and the
representatives of the army, of the Senate, of the municipal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
authorities, and of the diplomatic corps surrounded
them. All the pomp and splendor of the Catholic service,
all the opulence of France’s great capital, all the beauty
and brilliancy of the court, all the grim majesty of the
military; science, art, and lavish luxury,—all were united
and exhausted on the incidents and displays of this momentous
occasion.</p>

<p>At last all was over, and to the echoing shouts of “<i>Vive
l’Impératrice!</i>” Eugénie de Montijo returned with her
imperial consort to the palace of the Tuileries.</p>

<p>The career of the great Napoleonic dynasty is without
a parallel either in ancient or modern times. Long since,
the universal judgment of mankind has decided that its
founder, Napoleon I., was in every respect as great a
hero, and probably a greater, than Alexander, Cæsar, or
Charlemagne, the three most renowned representatives of
ambitious daring in the world’s history. The variety and
extent of Napoleon’s abilities, both as a commander, a
legislator, and a ruler, place him above all his rivals;
while the splendor of his victories, the extent of his conquests,
and the grandeur of his elevation, exceeds theirs
in an eminent degree.</p>

<p>“But in addition to all these elements of superior
greatness, the family of Napoleon I. add an unequal attraction
to his career. None of his illustrious rivals could
boast of a wife as graceful and bewitching as Josephine,
or as high-born and nobly descended as Maria Louisa.
None could claim brothers as sagacious as Joseph, as
gallant as Murat, as capable as Lucien, as romantic as
Jerome. None could point to as many relatives who
were sovereign princes and princesses, and who owed
their lofty elevations to his own powerful arm. And
none had a successor equal in talent and in desperate,
successful daring, to Napoleon III.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span></p>

<p>Charles Louis Napoleon Bonaparte, son of Louis Napoleon,
king of Holland, and Hortense, daughter of the
Empress Josephine and of her first husband, the Viscomte
de Beauharnais, was born at Paris, on the 20th of
April, 1808. Along the whole line of the <i>grande armée</i>,
and throughout the entire extent of the Empire, from
Hamburg to Genoa, and from the Danube to the Atlantic,
salvos of artillery announced the happy event. This
was an honor which fell to the lot of only two members of
the imperial family, Louis Napoleon and the king of
Rome, for they only were born under the imperial <i>régime</i>.
It is not our purpose, in this short sketch of the life of
the Empress Eugénie, to trace the career of Napoleon
III., except in so much only as it bears upon her own.</p>

<p>The Revolution of 1848 was over, and France needed
a monarch skilled to rule in a reign of peace. Three very
poor specimens of that article had been tried, in the persons
of Louis XVIII., Charles X., and Louis Philippe,
and had proved miserable failures. They did no great
harm, because they did nothing at all.</p>

<p>“Providence wrested the useless sceptre from the last,
and bestowed it upon Napoleon III.”</p>

<p>Truly “there is nothing so successful as success,” and
never has it been more clearly illustrated than in the history
of Louis Napoleon. All writers who have narrated
the events of his life, when in the full plentitude of his
power he sat upon his throne at the Tuileries, have extolled
him as a demi-god, and praised in most extravagant
terms his wonderful abilities; but those who have written
since the fall of the Empire denounce him as a cold and
selfish conspirator and revolutionist, <i>roué</i>, and libertine;
and declare “that among the rulers of Christendom in
modern times there is not one whose record is so utterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
devoid of any redeeming act, so entirely dictated by selfishness,
lust, and sordid greed, as that of Charles Louis
Napoleon.”</p>

<p>Between these two extremes lies the truth, and among
the defeats and disasters of 1870 we must not forget the
glories and triumphs of 1855. This much is certain, that
from the time of his attainment of the supreme power,
Louis Napoleon exhibited <i>administrative talent</i> of the
first order. France was governed with the regularity
and system of a gigantic piece of machinery. More
vigor, energy, and harmony had never before pervaded
the administration. It was said of Augustus, that he
found Rome brick and left it marble. That saying
would not be exaggerated if applied to Louis Napoleon
and Paris. The gay capital of the Empire was the special
object of his care, and Paris seemed to have thrown off
the dingy and faded habiliments of past ages, which still
clung to her, and to have assumed the freshness, beauty,
and energy of youth. Public monuments, palaces, temples,
and boulevards were, by his orders, embellished,
enlarged, renovated, and repaired. Old Paris disappeared,
and new Paris started up in its place. Dark,
dirty, ill-paved, and worse-drained streets were replaced
by noble boulevards full of palaces. He completed the
Louvre, reconstructed the Tuileries, regenerated the Palais
Royal, and interminably prolonged the Rue de Rivoli.</p>

<p>“His acts and deeds speak for themselves, and they
prove, on undeniable evidence, that France was never
better governed than by him. A people as fickle as the
wind, as restless as the sea; a people as whimsical as
women, as fanciful as children; a people with whom novelty
is a mania and faction a disease; a people brave,
intelligent, and generous by fits, and treacherous, frivolous,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
and vindictive by starts,—such a people could have
been governed at that crisis only by such a ruler. And
single-handed, by the sheer force of his genius, and the
moral power which is the body-guard of genius, he governed
them wisely and well. In spite of almost invincible
opposition, in the face of almost unsurmountable obstacles,
he raised them, step by step, to be regarded as the
most enlightened nation of Europe; he unsparingly promoted
their national welfare, he perceptibly diminished
their national evils; in short, for nearly twenty years he
was the glory of France and the wonder of the world.”</p>

<p>The alliance between France and England having terminated
so gloriously for the arms and diplomacy of both
countries, the emperor and empress of the French, in
1855, visited Queen Victoria in her own dominions, probably
the first instance on record in which a reigning French
monarch set foot upon the soil of his hereditary foes.
The rejoicings on this occasion were prodigious, and
Louis Napoleon, who had once paced the streets of London
a penniless wanderer, was received in the same
capital with universal greetings, with flying banners, with
military salutes, with the congratulations of the sovereign
and nobility, and with the joyful acclamations of the millions.
Albert and Victoria in a short time returned the
compliment, and the scene was transferred from London
to Paris. “On that memorable occasion France’s gay
and brilliant capital, that great centre of the world’s
civilization and luxury, assumed unwonted hues of splendor,
exhibited scenes of unusual festivity and rejoicing,
and exhausted her varied and infinite resources to impress,
delight, and charm her august visitors.”</p>

<p>The felicity of Louis Napoleon was now about to
receive a further augmentation, and his sudden and vigorous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[455]</a></span>
empire to be strengthened by an additional element of
perpetuity and power. On the 16th of March, 1856, a
son was born at the palace of the Tuileries. On that
occasion, the emperor thus addressed the Senate: “The
Senate has participated in my joy on hearing that Heaven
has given me a son, and you have hailed as a happy event
the birth of a child of France. I intentionally make use
of that expression. In fact, the Emperor Napoleon, my
uncle, who had applied to the new system created by the
Revolution all that was great and elevated in the old
<i>régime</i>, had resumed that ancient denomination of the
children of France. The reason is, gentlemen, that when
an heir is born who is destined to perpetuate a national
system, that child is not only the scion of a family, but
also in truth the son of the whole country, and that appellation
points out to him his duties. If this were true
under the old monarchy, which represented exclusively
the privileged class, how much more so is it now, when
the sovereign is the elect of the nation, the first citizen of
the country, and the representative of the interests of all?
I thank you for the kind wishes which you have expressed
for this child of France and for the empress.”</p>

<p>The birth of the Prince Imperial realized national hopes
long deferred. And never was title more perfectly representative
of truth and fact, than that of “<i>Fils de
France</i>.” The son of France,—the son of the nation,—the
gift of Providence to the people. It was in this sense
that the title was bestowed, and in this sense that it was
interpreted by the country. Throughout France the joy
manifested was excessive, and the municipal authorities
and public bodies of all kinds came forward with affectionate
eagerness to manifest their sympathy in the happiness
of their sovereign. What prophet could then have foretold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[456]</a></span>
that Napoleon Eugène Louis Jean Joseph, Prince
Imperial, and <i>Fils de France</i>, whose birth was now so
proudly hailed, whose future seemed so brilliant, and who
was heir to the grandest throne in Europe, would, in a
few years, be an exile in a foreign land, and that ultimately,
at the early age of twenty-three, the javelins of
hostile savages would terminate his career amid the wilds
of Africa?</p>

<p>It is a bright May afternoon in the year 1857, and
every avenue leading to the vast area of the <i>Champ de
Mars</i> is crowded with endless masses of troops, marching
with stately tread and martial music to the grand rendezvous.
For his Majesty Napoleon III. is to hold, in
honor of the Grand Duke Constantine of Russia, one of
those public reviews by which he exhibits, to such great
advantage, the strength and majesty of his army. As
far as the eye can reach, along both banks of the
Seine, and through the immense perspective of the
adjacent boulevards, glittering arms of cavalry and infantry
flash brightly in the rays of the refulgent sun. As
the hour of two tolls from the lofty towers of the
Invalides, seventy thousand men, disposed so as to produce
the most sublime and impressive effect, stand
motionless in military array, awaiting the approach of
that single man who has so heroically grasped and maintained
the sceptre of dominion in France.</p>

<p>The noble <i>façade</i> of the <i>École Militaire</i>, the splendid
dome of the <i>Hotel des Invalides</i>, the towering mass of the
<i>Arc de Triomphe</i>, and a hundred other monuments of
architectural beauty and historic celebrity, are within the
view, combining, with the majesty of military power
assembled in their centre, a <i>coup d’œil</i> of unrivalled magnificence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[457]</a></span></p>

<p>At length the graceful waving of red and white plumes,
and the gleam of polished silver helmets on the <i>Pont de
Jena</i>, the roll of a thousand drums and the music of a
thousand trumpets indicate the approach of Louis Napoleon
and his illustrious guest.</p>

<p>Surrounded by his magnificent <i>État Major</i>, composed
of the chief officers of all the regiments, the emperor
rides with military precision into the centre of the gorgeous
array. The <i>Champ de Mars</i>, familiar as it has
been with the glories of the First Empire, has never seen
the conqueror of Marengo and Austerlitz surrounded with
a halo of greater martial grandeur than this which now
encompasses this man who has never seen a solitary conflict
of arms or commanded a single battalion in the field.</p>

<p>On the right of the emperor, in the costume of a Russian
admiral, rides the Grand Duke Constantine, and on
his left the Prince Napoleon and the Duke of Nassau,
while behind them, in a sumptuous carriage, arrayed in
the most gorgeous and elegant of <i>toilettes</i>, the very picture
of loveliness and beauty, comes the Empress Eugénie.</p>

<p>Three times the splendid <i>cortège</i> passes through the
field; after which the emperor, the empress, and the
grand duke take up their positions under the central
pavilion of the <i>École Militaire</i>, and the <i>defile</i> begins.
During three hours seventy thousand men, composed of
seventy-four battalions of foot, sixty squadrons of cavalry,
and a hundred and fifty pieces of artillery, all
arrayed in new uniforms, with untarnished arms and accoutrements,
march by to the inspiring notes of martial
melody, and beneath a bright and propitious sky.
“Many of the regiments bear immortal names upon their
banners, which must forcibly remind the Grand Duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
Constantine of those far-famed and bloody struggles in
which the colossal power of the First Empire strove with
desperate energy and effort to crush forever the throne
of the Muscovite kings. Nevertheless, the grand duke
looks on complacently, and utters nothing but polite
phrases of praise and commendation.”</p>

<p>With such pageantries Louis Napoleon regaled and impressed
the splendor-loving Parisians. All the <i>pacific</i>
splendors of the First Empire were restored, and he
neglected no means of impressing upon his subjects and
upon the world the greatness of his power and the
security with which he sat upon his throne.</p>

<p>In the early part of the month of January, 1858, as
the carriage of the emperor and empress was approaching
the Italian Opera House, three bombs were aimed at their
persons, and exploded beneath the wheels. Many persons
were wounded, and some of those forming the
imperial escort were killed; but Napoleon and Eugénie
escaped unharmed.</p>

<p>The chief conspirators were Italian refugees, some of
whom suffered the well-merited penalty of death for their
sanguinary but unsuccessful purpose.</p>

<p>In an address, soon after, to the legislature, the emperor
mentioned the event. “I thank Heaven,” he said,
“for the visible protection which it has granted to the
empress and myself; and I deeply deplore that a plan for
destroying one life should have ended in the loss of so
many. Yet this thwarted scheme can teach us some useful
lessons. The recourse to such desperate means is but
a proof of the feebleness and impotence of the conspirators.</p>

<p>“And again, there never was an assassination which
served the interests of the men who armed the murderer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
Neither the party who struck Cæsar, nor that which slew
Henry IV., profited by their overthrow. God sometimes
permits the death of the just, but he never allows the
triumph of the evil agent. Thus these attempts neither
disturb my security in the present nor my trust in the
future. If I live, the Empire lives with me; if I fall, the
Empire will be strengthened by my death, for the indignation
of the people and of the army will be a new support
for the throne of my son. Let us, then, face the future
with confidence, and calmly devote ourselves to the welfare
and to the honor of our country. <i>Dieu protege la
France!</i>”</p>

<p>Alas! that Louis Napoleon, the prudent and sagacious
administrator of 1858, and the wise and powerful monarch
of 1867, should have become the short-sighted and inefficient
general of 1870.</p>

<p>And when, upon the ensanguined field of Sedan, the
star of the Second Empire fell to rise no more, and the
bloody demons of the Commune were carrying destruction
and death through the streets of beautiful Paris, Europe
and America—in short, the civilized world—re-echoed
the sentiment, exclaiming in the fulness of their anxious
minds, “<i>Dieu protege la France!</i>”</p>

<p>The year 1867 was a memorable one in the annals of
the Second Empire, for in it was held the Exposition Universelle,
in which the arts, the sciences, and industries
of the whole world were displayed with unequalled
magnificence.</p>

<p>France on that occasion fraternized with all nations,
and her resplendent capital was the admiration of eyes
of the universe. Here was the culmination of the happy
reign of Louis Napoleon and Eugénie. “The Empire was
peace,” and nations of every clime beheld the marvellous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>
progress of France under the administration of her sagacious
rulers. Unclouded happiness pervaded the land,
and untarnished glory shed a lustre over the Empire.</p>

<p>The first of July, 1867, a lovely day. The sun shone
brightly in a clear sky, and beautiful Paris never looked
so fair. The Exposition was at its height, and the gay
capital was crowded with distinguished visitors. On this
day Napoleon III. was to distribute prizes to the successful
competitors.</p>

<p>In the most gorgeous of state carriages, blazing with
red and gold, drawn by eight horses splendidly caparisoned,
and preceded and followed by Cent Gardes, squadrons
of Lancers, and officers and servants of the imperial
household, the emperor and empress left the Tuileries,
and at precisely two o’clock arrived at the <i>Palais de l’Industrie</i>,
in the <i>Champs Élysées</i>. The interior of the edifice
had been magnificently decorated for the occasion.
The semicircular glass roof was lined with a thin white
drapery dotted over with golden stars and bordered with
a band of pale green.</p>

<p>The galleries were hung with elegantly arranged crimson
velvet draperies trimmed with gold lace; while on
the fronts of the columns that supported the roof were
displayed the armorial bearings of the different nations
that had taken part in the Exhibition. All around the
floor of the vast hall were ranged, tier upon tier, rows of
crimson-colored benches, enough to seat twenty thousand
people. In the centre of one side of the hall, and
interrupting the terraces of encircling benches, was the
imperial throne, gorgeous in crimson and gold, and
whose velvet and golden, bee-spotted canopy, surmounted
by a massive crown, towered to the very roof. In great
folds of velvet of the richest hue,—darker than crimson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
and lighter than purple,—and relieved with embroidery
of gold, the curtains sloped gracefully to the
crimson and black moquette carpet of the <i>dais</i>, filling the
eye with a splendid blaze of color.</p>

<p>Here the Emperor Napoleon sat enthroned in the midst
of his guests and of his court. On his right was the
Sultan of Turkey, in a blue and gold uniform, and wearing
upon his breast the ribbon of the Legion of Honor and a
diamond star. On his left sat the Empress Eugénie
dressed in white, spotted with gold, with a mauve satin
train. On her head she wore a green wreath surmounted
by diamonds; diamonds in her ears, a diamond necklace
which fell in long pendants upon her breast, and a diamond
stomacher. This glittering attire, in contrast with
the dark draperies of the throne, was very effective.</p>

<p>Next to the sultan sat the Prince of Wales. Then
came the Prince of Orange, the Prince of Saxony, and
the Prince Imperial; and next to him, the Grand Duchess
Marie, the Duke of Aosta, the Duke of Cambridge, and
the Princess Mathilde, by the side of whom, in a crimson
and gold brocaded petticoat and a black tunic bordered
with gold lace, sat the brother of the Japanese Tycoon.
On the left of the empress were the Prince Royal of
Prussia, the Princess of Saxony, Prince Humbert of
Italy, Prince Napoleon, and Abdul Hamed, son of the
sultan.</p>

<p>In the second row were the members of the Murat and
Bonaparte families, and behind all were the marshals of
France, the ministers of state, the officers of the imperial
household, and the Turkish beys and pachas in attendance
upon the sultan.</p>

<p>Between twenty and thirty thousand people were present
at the ceremony, the ladies attired in splendid toilets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
of the lightest and brightest tints, while the gentlemen
were either in evening dress, in some picturesque national
costume, or in uniform. Nothing could be more striking
than the immense variety of the latter.</p>

<p>“There were Turks in fezes and turbans, surtouts literally
covered with gold lace, and in long robes of gorgeous
colors; Hungarian magnates in blue velvet tunics bejewelled
all over, crimson pantaloons fringed with gold,
and felt hats with diamond aigrettes and clusters of
feathers; Japanese dignitaries in cloth of gold, with light
blue petticoats, scarlet breeches, white stockings, patent
leather shoes, and spiked hats fringed with gold or silver
lace; Tunisians in green and gold, with diamond ornaments
in front of their crimson fezes; Austrian uhlans in
their well-known and picturesque uniforms; Persians wearing
the tall national head-dress; and Siamese in their flat
hats, short brocaded tunics, and baggy satin breeches.</p>

<p>“There were, moreover, the members of the Council of
State, senators, deputies, and prefects in their elaborately
embroidered costumes; with the lord mayors of London
and Dublin, aldermen, sheriffs, councilmen, masters of
arts, and doctors of divinity. Beyond these were endless
varieties of French, Russian, German, Italian, Dutch,
and British military and naval uniforms.</p>

<p>“Stars, crosses, and ribbons of every order under the
sun, met the eye in all directions.”</p>

<p>The proceedings were opened with Gluck’s overture to
“Iphigenie en Aulide.”</p>

<p>At its conclusion M. Rouher, vice-president of the Exposition,
addressed the emperor at considerable length.</p>

<p>The emperor thus replied:—</p>

<p>“Gentlemen, after an interval of twelve years I have
come for the second time to distribute rewards to those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
who have most distinguished themselves in those works
which enrich nations, embellish life, and soften manners.
The poets of antiquity sang the praises of those great
games in which the various nations of Greece assembled to
contend for the prize of the race. What would they say
to-day were they to be present at these Olympic games of
the world, in which all nations, contesting by intellect,
seem to launch themselves simultaneously in the infinite
career of progress towards an ideal incessantly approached,
without ever being able to be attained? From all parts
of the earth the representatives of science, of art, and of
industry have hastened to vie with each other, and we
may say that peoples and kings have both come to do
honor to the efforts of labor, and to crown them by their
presence with the idea of conciliation and peace. The
Exhibition of 1867 may be justly termed ‘universal,’ for
it unites the elements of all the riches of the globe.</p>

<p>“Side by side with the latest improvements of modern
art appear the products of the remotest ages, so that
they represent, at one and the same time, the genius of all
nations and all ages.</p>

<p>“It is universal, for in addition to the marvels luxury
brings forth for the few, it displays also that which is
demanded by the necessities of the many.</p>

<p>“The interests of the laboring classes have never aroused
more lively solicitude. Their moral and material wants,
their education, the conditions of life at a cheap rate, the
most productive combinations of association, have been
the object of patient inquiries and serious study. Thus
all improvements go forward. If science, by turning
matter to account, liberates labor, the cultivation of the
mind, by subduing vices, prejudices, and vulgar passions,
also liberates humanity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span></p>

<p>“Let us congratulate ourselves, gentlemen, upon having
received among us the majority of the sovereigns
and princes of Europe, and so many distinguished visitors.
Let us be proud of having shown to them France as she
is,—great, prosperous, and free. One must be destitute
of all patriotic faith to doubt her greatness; must close
one’s eyes to evidence to deny her prosperity; must misunderstand
her institutions, tolerant sometimes even of
license, not to behold in them liberty. I thank the imperial
commission, the members of the jury and the different
committees, for the intelligent zeal they have displayed in
the accomplishment of their tasks. I thank them also in
the name of the Prince Imperial, whom, notwithstanding
his tender age, I have been happy to associate in this
great undertaking of which he will retain the remembrance.
I hope the Exhibition of 1867 will mark a new era of harmony
and progress. Assured that Providence blesses the
efforts of all who, like ourselves, desire good, I believe in
the definitive triumph of the great principles of morality
and justice, which, while satisfying all legitimate desires,
are alone able to consolidate thrones, to elevate nations,
and to ennoble humanity.”</p>

<p>The names of the exhibitors to whom the chief prizes—gold
or silver medals—had been awarded were then
read. They had been marshalled in procession, two and
two, under the distinctive banners of the various groups
into which the Exhibition was divided. The whole number
was about nine hundred. One by one, as each name
was called, the exhibitors ascended the steps of the throne,
and received from the hands of the emperor the ribbon
belonging to the decoration of the Legion of Honor. At
the close of the distribution, the imperial party, leaving
their seats on the throne, and headed by the Corps Diplomatique,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
passed entirely round the hall, amid the most
enthusiastic plaudits, while the orchestra of twelve hundred
pieces played the chorus of Handel’s oratorio of
“Judas Maccabeus,”—“See! the Conquering Hero
comes.”</p>

<p>In the matter of dress, if in no other, the name of the
Empress Eugénie will be historical. It was within her
province to decide what fashions should prevail in France,
in Europe, in America, and in some parts of Asia; and
the marvellous <i>modes</i> she introduced among the ladies of
all countries have immortalized her. Her own costumes
were of the most elaborate construction, and were changed
with the greatest frequency. She displayed three or four
dresses in the course of each day, and even the most expensive
were never worn more than twice. Many writers
derived their income from describing in the journals of
the day these successive “creations” of the Paris milliner
and dressmaker.</p>

<p>She accumulated a collection of fans, furs, laces, and
jewels that probably surpassed any other in existence.</p>

<p>During the period that elapsed between her marriage
and her flight she received twenty thousand dollars pin-money
every month, which sum she never failed to spend
to the last cent.</p>

<p>Never in modern times have the fashions been more
elaborate and extravagant than while this “queen of
fashion” occupied the palaces of France.</p>

<p>Eugénie was fitted by nature to play the part of Lady
Bountiful and dwell in the House Beautiful. The city of
Paris voted her a large sum for the purchase of jewels;
she accepted the money, but requested permission to
devote it to founding an institution for the education of
young girls of the working classes. She further bestowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[466]</a></span>
in charity twenty thousand dollars of a present of fifty
thousand given her at the same time by the emperor; and
her reign was marked by many other striking gifts to
charitable and scientific objects.</p>

<p>The empress was partial to colored servitors. At one
time she had a Nubian page, and on his death took a
young Abyssinian into her service, whose daily duty it
was to stand immediately behind her chair at dinner, in
front of the line of tall, fresh-colored, clean-shaven, powdered
lacqueys, in green, scarlet, and gold liveries, who
encircled the imperial dining-table.</p>

<p>The empress gave also a great number of splendid and
costly entertainments at the Tuileries, Compiègne, Fontainebleau,
and elsewhere. State balls were numerous,
especially during the latter years of the Empire. These
took place usually at the Tuileries. The invitations, having
been drawn up by the high chamberlain from a carefully
prepared list of some ten thousand persons, were
distributed by mounted servants in the imperial livery of
green and gold.</p>

<p>The guests arrived at the vast marble vestibule, and,
ascending the grand staircase, were received on the landing
by a splendidly attired official, who took from them
their cards of invitation. The ball took place in the <i>Salle
des Marcheaux</i>, the largest and most splendidly decorated
<i>salon</i> in the palace, and at its conclusion supper was
served in the <i>Galerie de Diane</i>. All the old forms of
etiquette in vogue at the court of Louis XIV. were revived;
and had the <i>Grand Monarque</i> been present at a
ball in the Tuileries Palace, he would no doubt have felt
as much at home, as far as all forms and ceremonies were
concerned, as in his own <i>Galerie des Glaces</i>, at Versailles.</p>

<p>Twice during the absence of the emperor, once in 1865,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[467]</a></span>
when he was in Algeria, and again in 1870, during the
Franco-Prussian War, Eugénie was left the nominal head
of the state, with the title of Empress-Regent. At the
opening of the Suez Canal, in 1869, she was present in
the yacht <i>l’Aigle</i>, and took a chief part in the celebration.
The <i>Aigle</i> formed one of the “inauguration fleet” of
forty-five vessels, and took the lead in making the passage
to the Red Sea, where, with the empress on board,
it arrived on the 22d of November, returning the next
day to the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>“It was mid-afternoon on such a May day as is seen
only under Parisian skies. But the invitation of the sky
could not alone account for the multitudes thronging the
leafy park, the blooming <i>parterres</i> of the gardens, and the
broad ways of the <i>Champs Élysées</i>. The court was about
to set out for St. Cloud, and the pleasure-loving Parisians
were to be treated to a spectacle.</p>

<p>“Gorgeous lines of soldiery formed in statuesque ranks
along the pebbly walks and hot asphalt ways facing the
palace. Save for the waving plumes, the glistening wall
rested immobile and silent as the granite sphinxes whose
solemn eyes blinked sleepily under the ardent sunshine.
There was just the perception of a movement in the shining
cuirasses as the swelling notes of a cavalry bugle echoed
and re-echoed in sonorous blasts through the crowded
aisles of the park and died away far over the turrets of
the palace. The Imperial Guards, flaming in scarlet and
glittering casques, formed in serried ranks from the Rivoli
gates and the <i>Place du Carrousel</i> to the borders of the
Seine. Outriders in the magenta and gold of the line
dashed in excited movement along the gravelled roadways,
adjusting the obstacles, for the imperial advent.
Squadrons of the guards formed on each side of the wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
way through which the procession was to pass to the
<i>Champs Élysées</i>. On a signal from the trumpets, they
divided, facing their horses inward, and waited immovable
as the Egyptian figures at the golden gate. A thin
column of smoke curled upward from the Arch of the
Carrousel, a loud, cracking detonation of artillery announced
that majesty was about to leave the palace,
another that majesty was in the vestibule, and the long
line of fire made by the red-breeched troopers moved, as
with one impulse, into an attitude of respectful attention.”
From the central porch of the Tuileries, as the guards
came to a salute, a short, stout figure, clad in a gentleman’s
walking-dress, appeared, and slowly descended the
velvet-carpeted steps. To the salutations of the soldiers
and the populace he slightly raised his hat. The crowd
in the rear broke into shouts of “<i>Vive l’Empereur!</i>”
Halting, as the lackeys held the door of the landau open,
the emperor half turned.</p>

<p>A lady, tall, slight, and graceful, appeared in the group
at the door-way. She was speaking with animation to
the chamberlain, with her face to the multitude. Her
black eyes were full of life and vivacity, and her hair,
coiled in great masses over her shapely head, shone like
burnished copper as the sunbeams fall upon it. “She
tripped lightly down the broad steps, a sunshade in her
right hand serving as a walking-cane, while with her left
she upheld with charming daintiness a robe of silver-gray
color. As the outlines of her figure became distinct upon
the crimson carpet, a tumultuous cry of ‘<i>Vive l’Impératrice!</i>’
resounded far back in the shrubberies of the garden.
The lady bowed with gracious recognition, and,
giving her hand to the emperor, stepped into the landau.
At the same moment a graceful youth of fourteen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
mounted on a jet-black pony, shot out from the entrance
of the Carrousel, and riding close to the carriage, reined
in suddenly, and raising his hat, brought it down to the
saddle as he bent to the occupants. ‘<i>Vive le Prince Impérial!</i>’
shouted the crowd; and the emperor, empress,
and prince bowed gravely in response.</p>

<p>“The trumpets broke into another long blast, the postilions
touched their horses; majesty was <i>en route</i>, the
prince riding beside the imperial carriage, the troopers
falling into groups of four.</p>

<p>“Who of all that crowd, filling the palace gardens and
thronging the banks of the Seine, would have then told
<i>Cæsar</i> that he should never again pass those fateful portals
in state?</p>

<p>“The Parisians afterwards recalled the event as the
Romans had the journey of the great Julius from the
tearful pleadings of Calpurnia to the base of Pompey’s
statue. But there was nothing of the Ides of March in
the emperor’s reception on the present occasion. The
acclamations of the multitude were spontaneous and
hearty, and all hats flew off when the benignant smiles
of Eugénie supplemented the gracious inclinations of
Napoleon.”</p>

<p>On the 15th of July, 1870, Louis Napoleon declared
war with Prussia. The numerous vicissitudes of his
eventful life may have suggested to him the possibility
that the war, if long protracted, might prove unfavorable
to his hopes; but no seer could have predicted to him
that, in seven weeks from that day, he would be defeated,
dethroned, and a prisoner in the hands of the one
man among all the crowned heads of Europe whom he most
hated, and that all the hopes which he had cherished of
the perpetuation of a Bonaparte dynasty in France would
be at an end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span></p>

<p>We cannot, in this short sketch, attempt to portray the
progress of this war, which, in its rapid movement, its
terrible destructiveness, and its stupendous results, is
without a parallel in history. Suffice it that, with the
defeat of the French army at Sedan, the star fell. An
empire which had progressed through nearly twenty
years, ran out in a moment like a reel of thread. Napoleon
was sent as state prisoner to Wilhelmshöhe, the
Germans entered France, marched to Paris, and William,
king of Prussia, slept in the palace of the <i>Grand Monarque</i>.</p>

<p>And now occurred one of those strange anomalies
which the history of France so often presents.</p>

<p>It is the 18th of January, 1871. The grand gallery of
Versailles is filled with an eager, anxious throng. But it
is not such a throng as has been wont to gather here.
Where are the cavaliers, with their red-heeled boots and
slashed doublets, and the <i>grandes dames</i>, with their lofty
plumes and flashing jewels?</p>

<p>The top-boot, the clanking spur, the sword, and sabre-tache,
these are the accoutrements of this band of stern,
martial men who now stand beneath Le Brun’s gorgeous
frescoes. At one end of the gallery a throne is erected, and
its presence reminds us of that silver throne erected here
in 1685, at whose foot the Doge of Genoa bowed in homage,
and upon whose summit, the personification of pompous
pride and royal prerogative, stood King Louis XIV.
But no king or emperor of France stands upon the throne
of the Versailles gallery on this 18th day of January,
1871. A king is there, it is true, but he is William, king
of Prussia, who is this day to be proclaimed Emperor of
Germany. It seems like fate, like an avenging Nemesis,
that in this palace of Versailles, whose marble portals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
bear the inscription, “To all the glories of France,”—in
this <i>Grande Galerie des Glaces</i>, the scene of so many
glories, and triumphs of the houses of Bourbon and of
Bonaparte,—the crown of United Germany should be
placed, with mighty shout and loud acclaim, upon the
head of that stern old warrior, William I. of Hohenzollern.</p>

<p>The last four weeks of her abode in France the Empress
Eugénie spent at the Tuileries. Those were days
of confusion and distress. The series of defeats which
culminated at Sedan had already begun, and a proclamation
had appeared declaring Paris in a state of siege.
Still the empress was hopeful. “She thought with a
lady’s romantic ideas about military possibilities,” says
a narrator, “that everything could be retrieved by a
<i>grand coup</i>.”</p>

<p>But then came the news of the emperor’s surrender at
Sedan. Eugénie was up all night; council after council
was held, as new reports and scraps of information arrived.
Finally it was decided that she should ride on
horseback through the streets of Paris, and herself proclaim
to the unpopular legislature its dissolution. This
resolution, however, was never carried into effect, for lack
of a riding-dress! A plain, black habit, with the cross of
the Legion of Honor pinned upon her breast, was what
she had decided to wear. Was it a fatality that out of
the three hundred and sixty dresses then hanging in their
wardrobes at the Tuileries, the needed one was missing?
A few days before there had been a general stampede of
servants, who had gone off, carrying great quantities of
imperial property, and the dark riding-dress, which the
empress now sought, had probably been among the spoils
of her domestics. There was only one habit to be found,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span>
and that was neither black nor plain. It was a dress of
gorgeous green, embroidered with gold, and designed to
be worn with a three-cornered Louis XV. hat, the costume
of the imperial hunt at Fontainebleau. This was pronounced,
with evident justice, to be too theatrical, and the
enterprise was consequently abandoned.</p>

<p>“What grotesque mischances mar great destinies and
shift potent purposes!” The lack of a spur by the messenger
whom Louis XVI. had sent to call M. de Machault
to the post of prime minister, delayed his departure, and
thus—by giving Madame Adelaide time to write, in favor
of her friend the Count de Maurepas, to that feeblest of
monarchs who, not being able to withstand the strongly
worded appeal of his strong-minded aunt, recalled his
messenger as he was mounting his horse,—caused an entire
change in the policy of the ministry of the kingdom.</p>

<p>And now “the lack of a petticoat—on the testimony
of Thiers himself, who spoke of it afterward—brought
about the expulsion of a dynasty; for had the woman,
pathetic in her misfortune, ridden out among the multitude,
like Elizabeth to Tilbury fort, the chivalrous sentiment
of Paris would have acclaimed her, and the history
of a people would have been written in less lurid colors.”</p>

<p>Upon the fourth of September, the mob so long feared
made its appearance. The infuriated insurgents to the
number of one hundred and fifty thousand crowded the
Tuileries gardens, the <i>Place de la Concorde</i>, and the
<i>Champs Élysées</i>, shouting, “Down with the Empire!
down with Bonaparte! death to the man of December!”</p>

<p>At two o’clock in the afternoon, Signor Nigra, the
Italian ambassador, entered the empress’ apartment, to
tell her that the time for flight had come. “You have
not an instant to lose,” he said. “The revolutionists are
entering the palace by the <i>Place du Carrousel</i>.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span></p>

<p>And now for the first time Eugénie’s courage wavered;
but she mastered her emotion, and giving her hand to
the ambassador, with a melancholy flash of her old imperial
grandeur, said calmly, “I will take leave of our
friends.”</p>

<p>“The door of the white drawing-room was thrown
open, and the empress appeared for a moment on the
threshold—an inexpressibly touching figure, in her simple
black dress and white collar. She made a courtesy and
waved her hand, trying hard to smile, while many—not
all of them women—were sobbing aloud. Then, with
gentle persuasion, Prince Richard Metternich, the Austrian
ambassador, drew her back, and the door was closed
again.”</p>

<p>Through the magnificent galleries of the Louvre, hung
with the masterpieces of Rubens, Van Dyke, Leonardo,
Poussin, Claude, and the imperishable dynasties of art,
fled the Empress Eugénie and her few faithful followers.</p>

<p>The square of St. Germain L’Auxerrois was empty.
A cab stood by the curb. The veiled empress and Madame
Carette, her lady-in-waiting, escorted by Signor
Nigra, Prince Metternich, and M. Ferdinand de Lesseps,
approached it.</p>

<p>Sinking back upon the cushions, Eugénie for an instant
raised her veil to catch a last glimpse of the Louvre. As
her eye rested on that fatal colonnade, where Catherine de’
Medici and the king had stood on the night of St. Bartholomew,
a little ragamuffin, seated on the stone foundation
of the golden railing, started up, shouting, “There is
the empress!”</p>

<p>A group of artisans, lounging at the corner, vaguely
caught the cry and came forward. But M. Ferdinand de
Lesseps, with admirable presence of mind, caught the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>
urchin, whirled him round and sent him sprawling in the
roadway, saying furiously:—</p>

<p>“Ah, you are crying ‘<i>Vive l’Empereur</i>,’ are you?
That will teach you to hurrah for the Bonapartes, when
the Republic is proclaimed.”</p>

<p>The group on the sidewalk approved this laudable
sentiment. M. de Lesseps sprang inside, with the empress.
The cab was whirled away; and thus ended for
Eugénie de Montijo the empty dream of greatness, by
which she had been so long beguiled.</p>

<p>Leaving Paris, she embarked on board the yacht <i>Gazelle</i>,
and was conveyed to England, where Victoria and
the royal family received her with great kindness, and
placed at her disposal the beautiful country residence of
Camden Place, Chiselhurst. Here she was joined by the
Prince Imperial, and later by Louis Napoleon.</p>

<p>“Camden Place, Chiselhurst, 1871. A gentleman
sixty-three years of age, a lady, and a youth of fifteen
are resting in the pleasure grounds of an English rural
mansion. This does not seem much. But this gentleman
is he who, a twelvemonth since, was emperor of the
French nation, and the most powerful monarch in Europe.
He is a student and a writer—as well as an actor—of
history, which must have taught him the value of an imperial
title. Can he think it worth the pursuit or possession,
having once sat upon a throne which was perhaps
not so agreeable as his present seat on the Chiselhurst
garden-chair? If he desires, for himself or for his son,
to leave Camden Place, or a similar abode, and go back
to the Tuileries Palace, we can only say it is a matter of
taste.”</p>

<p>But Louis Napoleon was not destined to behold again
the Tuileries Palace. On the 9th of January, 1873, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>
died, consoled by the presence of the empress, but not of
the Prince Imperial, who, summoned from Woolwich, arrived
too late to see him alive.</p>

<p>All the hopes and affections of the widowed empress
then centred in her son, and his recent fate cannot but
be remembered. He joined the expedition to Zululand,
and on the first of June, 1879, perished by the javelins of
the savages while scouting with a few companions. On
the 10th of July, the body arrived in England, and on
the 12th the final ceremony took place at Chiselhurst. It
was a soldier’s funeral, but there was no glare and glitter
of martial splendor.</p>

<p>Mind rather than matter was pre-eminent in giving
voice to the public sorrow. At the head of the military
pageant, whose every feature was pervaded with a genuine
pathos, marched the cadets of the Royal Military Academy,
Woolwich, with arms reversed; then, to the solemn
strains of the “Dead March,” the Royal Artillery Band;
then the cross before the gun; and then the gun, drawn
by six dark-brown horses by whose sides rode mounted
artillerymen. The coffin above the gun was wrapped in
the English and French flags. The sword of the prince,
his belt, and sabre-tache were placed upon it; while on
a cushion were the great cross and ribbon of the Legion
of Honor.</p>

<p>By the side of the coffin walked the pall-bearers, the
Duke of Cambridge, the Duke of Connaught, the Crown
Prince of Sweden and Norway, and M. Rouher on the
left. The Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales,
Prince Leopold, and the Duke of Bassano on the right.
Behind the coffin came the prince’s favorite horse, “Stag,”
caparisoned in the white and silver starred trappings of
the imperial stable, and led by M. Gamble, the faithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
retainer who had attended the baptism of the prince, and
who now followed his coffin. Next came the chief mourners,
Prince Napoleon and his sons, Prince Victor and
Prince Louis; Prince Lucien Bonaparte, Prince Joachim
Murat, Prince Napoleon Charles Bonaparte, and Prince
Louis Murat.</p>

<p>After these came the great officers of the imperial
crown, and many personages of princely rank not related
by kindred.</p>

<p>So mournful a ceremony was not regarded in the light
of a spectacle, and even the elements accorded with the
nature of the scene. There was no sun to flash from the
polished helmets of the Lancers, or linger on the gold
of the splendidly mounted Horse-Artillery.</p>

<p>“It was an unusual and impressive sight to see that
strangely and variously composed line of soldiers on
horseback, and priests and mourners on foot, moving
slowly along the serpentine road across the great, uneven
plain of the common, with thousands of spectators
stationary on either hand.”</p>

<p>To those who thought of the widowed, childless empress
in her lonely house, and knew that the chief mourners
were princes, and that the queen was watching the procession
from her black tribune, unless she had left it to
console the sorrowing mother, the sight was much more
than impressive.</p>

<p>“The tragic elements which prevailed at the death of
the prince, the inexpressible desolation of the imperial
mother, the lessons of mutability in human affairs which
the case enforced upon the mind, the remembrance of the
virtues of the departed young man, and the tale of broken
hopes, baffled aspirations, and defeated purposes, which
the circumstances so clearly exhibited, preoccupied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[477]</a></span>
thoughts and feelings of the mourners, and shut off for
the time being all interest in the mere external traits of
the scene. The realities to which it pointed stood out so
clearly from the outward semblances in which they were
pictured, that the latter were forgotten, and the overpowering
force of the former were exclusively recognized.</p>

<p>“Seldom in recent times has any public ceremonial so
closely touched the hearts of those who took part in it.”</p>

<p>And now in the little Roman Catholic church at Chiselhurst,
by the side of the emperor his father, lies all that
was mortal of Napoleon Eugène Louis Jean Joseph,
Prince Imperial.</p>

<p><i>Requiescat in pace.</i></p>

<p>Under the elms at Chiselhurst, at the close of a mild
spring afternoon, we may see a lady walking. Her figure,
once so straight and graceful, is slightly bowed with
age, and her fast-whitening hair is covered by a widow’s
cap. And as she turns toward us her sad face, still retaining
the traces of its former loveliness, we recognize her
whom we have seen seated, amid the pomp and pageantry
of a court, upon the throne at the Tuileries Palace, and
flying with her scanty escort through the galleries of the
Louvre,—Eugénie de Montijo, Comtesse de Téba, the
once brilliant empress of the French.</p>

<h2>QUEEN VICTORIA.<br>

<small>A.D. 1819.</small></h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Broad based upon her people’s will,</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And compassed by the inviolate sea.”</span></div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 12em;"><span class="smcap">Tennyson</span>, <i>To the Queen</i>.</span></div>
</div>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">FIFTY years a queen! and still seated upon her
ancestral throne. This is the remarkable record of
England’s present sovereign. This fact alone would
make the reign of Queen Victoria illustrious. But more
than this, she has reigned during one half of this marvellous
nineteenth century—a period phenomenal among the
centuries of history.</p>

<p>Although the Victorian Era has not produced a Shakespeare,
a Homer, a Dante, or a Milton, it will be remembered
as an epoch of astounding progress, not only in
England and Europe, but throughout the civilized world.</p>

<p>The unprecedented onrush of the mighty waves of
enlightened civilization, bearing to all lands the blessings
of Christian liberty; the flashing and dazzling lights
of wonderful inventions and results of scientific researches,
which have belted the world with gleaming
bands of iron, chained the lightning at man’s bidding,
caught and imprisoned the waves of sound, unlocked
the secrets of the earth, and almost annihilated space
and time,—these are some of the marvellous achievements
of the nineteenth century which make the history of the
past one hundred years read like the story of the most
amazing transformations ever invented by the imagination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
in Oriental fairy tales or attributed to the weird
magicians of the Arabian Nights.</p>

<p>Telegraphs, railroads, telephones, electric lights, phonographs,
photography, the discovery of petroleum, the
improved use of steam, the invention of Bessemer steel,
and the practical use of gaslight for the illumination of
cities, are all numbered among the inventions and discoveries
of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>But more wonderful still, perhaps, is the rise of the
mighty Republic of the United States, which, though
beginning in the eighteenth century as an independent
power, has, in the short space of a little more than one
hundred years, taken the foremost place in the rank of
nations, and stands to-day <i>the miracle of the nineteenth
century</i>.</p>

<p>To have reigned for fifty years, the sovereign of one of
the greatest powers of the world, during such a time of
human progress and religious liberty, will make the Victorian
Age shine forth in the pages of history as one of
the most resplendent epochs in the annals of the world.</p>

<p>Alexandrina Victoria, called by her German relations
“the little Mayflower,” was born on the 24th of May,
1819. She was the granddaughter of George III. of
England; her father being Edward, Duke of Kent, fourth
son of that monarch.</p>

<p>Her mother was Victoria, the sister of the Duke of Saxe-Coburg,
and widow of the Prince of Leiningen. The
baby Princess Victoria was left fatherless at the age of
eight months, and an establishment was formed for the
future queen at Kensington Palace, under the superintendence
of her mother, the Duchess of Kent. The education
of Victoria was carefully watched, although she was
not allowed to know that she was heir to the throne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span>
until she was twelve years old. At this time it was
thought best to make known to the little princess her
future prospects; and her tutor, Dr. Davys, gave her a
lesson in tracing out the genealogy of English royalty.
At length the young princess exclaimed, with some astonishment,
“Mamma, I cannot see who is to come after
Uncle William, unless it is myself.”</p>

<p>Upon being told that this was the fact, she said in an
unusually thoughtful manner for one so young:—</p>

<p>“It is a very solemn thing. Many a child would boast,
but they don’t know the difficulty. There is splendor,
but there is responsibility;” then, with an expressive
gesture, she earnestly continued, “<i>I will be good.</i>” And
the verdict of fifty years of sovereignty has been,
“Good mother, queen, and wife.”</p>

<p>At five o’clock, on the morning of the 21st of June,
1837, the Princess Victoria, then a young girl of eighteen,
was awakened from her slumbers and saluted as queen.
Hastily throwing over her night-robes a loose wrapper,
and with slippers on her bare feet, and hair in unregarded
disorder, she was ushered into an apartment where stood
the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham, who
had just arrived at Kensington, and demanded to see the
“Queen” immediately. State business will not wait for
ladies’ toilets, and the <i>déshabillé</i> of the young princess
was rather impressive than unbecoming, as the grave
elderly men bent the knee before her and addressed her
as “Your Majesty.” The king was dead, and Victoria
was queen. Even as the royal salutation fell upon her
youthful ears, the fair young girl seemed in a moment to
don a new garment of dignity and self-possession. She
had been always retiring, and obedient to others, to a
marked degree, but as the words “Your Majesty” were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
addressed to her for the first time, she instantly put out
her hand to receive the customary kiss of allegiance, and
even attired as she was, looked a very sovereign. From
that moment Victoria assumed all the dignity and prerogatives
of a queen. She had been the most docile of
daughters; but as queen, the Duchess of Kent, her mother,
received only her filial affection, and was allowed no privilege
of dictating the affairs of state, or even advising her
royal daughter regarding her actions or duties as sovereign.</p>

<p>The young queen took as her residence Buckingham
Palace, making Windsor Castle her country home. Mr.
Charles Greville says of her at this time: “The queen’s
manner and bearing are perfect. It is the remarkable union
of <i>naïveté</i>, kindness, nature,—good nature, with propriety
and dignity, which make her so admirable and so endearing
to those about her, as she certainly is. I have
been repeatedly told that they are all warmly attached to
her, but albeit all feel the impossibility of for a moment
losing sight of the respect which they owe her. She
never ceases to be a queen, and is always the most charming,
cheerful and obliging, unaffected queen in the world.”</p>

<p>On the 28th of June, 1838, occurred the coronation of
Queen Victoria. The famous musical composer, Felix
Mendelssohn, who was then in London, thus writes concerning
the imposing pageant: “At a quarter-past twelve
the procession began to arrive at Westminster Abbey, and
by an hour later the whole had been absorbed in the
cathedral. Nothing more brilliant could be seen than all
the beautiful horses, with their rich harness, the carriages
and grooms covered with gold embroideries, and the
splendidly dressed people inside. All this, too, was encircled
by the venerable gray buildings, and the crowds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[482]</a></span>
of common people under the dull sky, which was only now
and then pierced by sunbeams; at first, indeed, it rained.
But when the golden, fairy-like carriage, supported by
Tritons with their tridents and surmounted by the great
crown of England, drove up, and the graceful girl was
seen bowing right and left—when at that instant the
mass of people was completely hidden by their waving
handkerchiefs and raised hats, while one roar of cheering
almost drowned the pealing of the bells, the blare of the
trumpets, and thundering of the guns, one had to pinch
one’s self to make sure it was not all a dream out of the
Arabian Nights. Then fell a sudden silence, the silence
of a church, after the queen had entered the cathedral.
I mixed among the crowd, walked up to the door of the
abbey, and peered into the solemn obscurity; but my involuntary
emotion was dispelled by a sense of the ludicrous
as I looked closely at their dressed-up, modern <i>cinque-centi
halberdiers</i> (the beef-eaters), whose cheeks suggest
beef, and whose noses tell tales of whiskey and claret.”</p>

<p>Victoria wore a royal robe of crimson velvet, furred
with ermine and bordered with gold. A small circlet of
gold banded her head, and the collar of the Order of the
Garter adorned her neck. Three swords were borne
before her, emblems of justice, defence, and mercy. Her
train was carried by eight young maidens of high rank,
dressed in cloth of silver, with roses in their hair. After
the queen entered the cathedral and advanced to the foot
of the throne, she knelt there for a moment in devotion.
As she rose, the Archbishop of Canterbury turned her
round to each of the four corners of the abbey, saying to
the assembled people: “Sirs, I here present unto you the
undoubted queen of this realm. Will ye all swear to do
her homage?” Each time he asked the question the air
rang with shouts of “Long live Queen Victoria!”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[483]</a></span></p>

<p>The anointing followed, whereupon the archbishop
gave her his benediction. The primate then placed her on
the throne, or rather in St. Edward’s chair, used by the
sovereigns in this ceremony since Edward the Confessor.
The young queen then received the ring, betrothing her to
her people, and the orb of empire—a small globe surmounted
by a cross—was placed in her hand, and the
sceptre of rule was given to her. The crown of England
was then laid upon her head by the archbishop, and at the
same moment peers and peeresses donned their coronets;
bishops, their mitres; heralds, their caps; the trumpets
sounded, the drums beat, the cannon boomed, and the
Tower guns answered, and the shouts of the people broke
forth in loud and joyous acclamations. The archbishop
then presented the Bible to her Majesty, and bent in homage.
He was followed by bishops and lords, according to
their rank, who each in turn, lifting their coronets,
touched the crown on the queen’s head, and repeated the
oath of allegiance.</p>

<p>The Communion Service followed; and the queen, in
homage to the <i>King</i> of kings, removed her crown while
she received the sacrament. Then, resuming her royal
diadem, with the sceptre in one hand, and the orb of empire
in the other, the crowned queen of England left the
abbey, followed by her imposing retinue.</p>

<p>Mr. Charles Greville gives us this little bit of human
nature enacted between these pompous scenes of solemn
ceremony:—</p>

<p>“Lord John Thynne, who officiated for the Dean of
Westminster, told me that nobody knew what was to be
done, except the archbishop and himself (who had
rehearsed), Lord Willoughby (who is experienced in
these matters), and the Duke of Wellington; and consequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[484]</a></span>
there was a continual difficulty and embarrassment,
and the queen never knew what she was to do next.
They made her leave her chair and enter into St. Edward’s
chapel before the prayers were concluded, much to the discomfiture
of the archbishop. She said to John Thynne,
‘Pray tell me what I am to do, for they don’t know.’
And at the end, when the orb was put in her hand, she
said, ‘What am I to do with it?’ ‘Your Majesty is to
carry it, if you please, in your hand.’ ‘Am I?’ she
said; ‘it is very heavy.’ The ruby ring was made for
her little finger instead of the fourth, on which the Rubric
prescribes that it should be put. When the archbishop
was to put it on, she extended the former, but he said it
must be put on the latter. She said it was too small, and
she could not get it on. He said it was right to put it
there, and as he insisted, she yielded, but had first to
take off her other rings, and then this was forced on; but
it hurt her very much, and as soon as the ceremony was
over she was obliged to bathe her finger in iced water in
order to get it off.”</p>

<p>Most royal marriages have little to do with love and
sentiment, but that of Queen Victoria was a delightful exception.</p>

<p>It is a pretty scene, and one full of fascinating charm,
which presents the young queen making her offer of marriage
to the handsome young Prince Albert, son of the
Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld.</p>

<p>As she was a sovereign, the prince could not with propriety
make the offer to her, and so the blushing girl, now
the <i>woman</i> rather than the <i>queen</i>, in the presence of the
youth who had already gained her love, forgot the sovereign,
as she timidly took this momentous step.</p>

<p>Their married life was beautiful and happy, and within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
the sacred circle of such a love-life none have right to
enter, even though royal lives are considered public
property. No shadow seems to have come between their
perfect confidence; and the sweetest tribute to the character
of Queen Victoria fell from the lips of her dying
husband, when twenty years after, she bent over his death-bed,
and he lifted his trembling hand and stroked her
cheek, murmuring, “<i>Liebes Frauchen</i>” (dear little wife),
“<i>Gutes Weibchen</i>” (good little wife), and resting his
aching head upon her shoulder, saying, “It is very comfortable
so, dear child,” and having kissed her, fell asleep
in her arms, to waken no more on this side the river of
death.</p>

<p>We can only enumerate the most important political
events of Queen Victoria’s reign, without detailed description.
The Victorian Era will only rightly take its
place in the annals of history when the entire epoch
shall have become the past. While the present is weaving
the history for the future upon the loom of time,
it is impossible clearly to discern the intricacies of the
pattern, or rightly to estimate the importance of the various-colored
threads which are being employed to work
out the finished design. Only when the epoch has become
past history, can we truly measure its importance in the
annals of the world.</p>

<p>Although during the past fifty years there has been no
change in the sovereign of England, there have been vast
and momentous changes in the parties which control the
government of that nation. Prominent men in the ministry
have arisen and declined, and the position of the <i>English
people</i> to-day, as regards their influence in political
affairs, is much changed from the comparatively insignificant
part they played in past epochs. No longer does a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[486]</a></span>
despotic Elizabeth hold the lives of her people subject to
the caprices of her individual will; and more and more
clearly is the voice of that people, not only <i>heard</i>, but
<i>heeded</i>, even in the House of Lords.</p>

<p>At the time of Victoria’s coronation, a Whig ministry
was in power, led by Viscount Melbourne.</p>

<p>Queen Victoria was much attached to her first premier,
Lord Melbourne. But soon changes took place in the
ministry. The Conservatives, led by Sir Robert Peel,
came into power. Sir Robert Peel, remembering the pernicious
influence of <i>women-intriguers</i> in the time of Queen
Anne, insisted that the ladies of Victoria’s household
should be changed with the change of the ministry. But
Victoria was a very different woman and sovereign from
the weak-minded Anne. With indignation, she wrote:—</p>

<p>“They wanted to deprive me of my ladies, and I suppose
they would deprive me next of my dressers and my
housemaids; but I will show them that I am queen of
England.” And show them she did, and the Conservatives
were obliged to yield and retire, and Lord Melbourne
was recalled to office.</p>

<p>But in 1841, the Whigs were again succeeded by the
Conservatives; and Sir Robert Peel became prime minister.
He was succeeded in 1846 by Lord John Russell,
who was placed in power by the combined efforts of the
Protectionists and Whigs.</p>

<p>The Revolution in France, which resulted in the overthrow
of Louis Philippe and the ascension to the French
throne of Prince Louis Napoleon, as Napoleon III., occasioned
outbursts of the people in various parts of
Europe. There were wild threats of an insurrection in
London, but the scare passed over, and the preservation
of order was secured without bloodshed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span></p>

<p>The renowned Duke of Wellington was the chief military
authority in England, and the leader in the House of
Lords up to the time of his death, in 1852, in his eighty-fourth
year. The queen greatly mourned his loss. She
had given him the distinguished honor of standing godfather
to one of her own children, Prince Arthur, and
when she heard the news of his death she wrote:—</p>

<p>“What a loss! One cannot think of this country without
the duke, our immortal hero. In him centred almost
every earthly honor a subject could possess. Above
party, looked up to by all, revered by the whole nation,
the friend of the sovereign.”</p>

<p>In this same year the Conservatives again came into
power, with the Earl of Derby as premier. We cannot
give the various changes in the English ministry during
Victoria’s reign. Suffice it to say, the Derby ministry
retired in 1858, and were succeeded by the Palmerston
ministry. Again, Lord Palmerston was obliged by circumstances
to resign, and Lord Derby again came into
office. But he was soon deposed, and Lord Palmerston
returned to office as prime minister. On the death of
Viscount Palmerston in 1865, Lord John Russell again
became premier, but was soon defeated by the Conservatives,
who came into power with the Earl of Derby, and
Mr. Benjamin Disraeli. Lord Derby afterwards resigned,
and Disraeli became prime minister, and subsequently
received the title of Lord Beaconsfield. In 1880 Lord
Beaconsfield’s party was defeated, and a Liberal ministry
came in with Mr. Gladstone. Later changes it is not
necessary to note here.</p>

<p>The English wars during the last fifty years have been
wars in Afghanistan, the quelling of various revolts in
India, England’s alliance with France in the Crimean<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
War, the Abyssinian War in 1867, and the recent war
with Egypt, which resulted in the loss of several Englishmen
of note, especially the renowned and brave Chinese
Gordon, whose imprisonment and inhuman murder by
the savage followers of Mahdi, at Khartoum, called forth
loud denunciations against the military measures of the
English government.</p>

<p>The Franco-German War in 1870, resulting in the
downfall of Napoleon III., although not entered into by
England, was watched with intense anxiety by Queen
Victoria. Two of her daughters, the Princesses Victoria
and Alice, were obliged to see their husbands depart for
the seat of war, and the beloved Princess Alice devoted
herself with untiring energy to the care of the sick and
wounded soldiers. For the second time Queen Victoria
welcomed the fallen French monarchs to her realm. She
had received the family of Louis Philippe with kindness;
and the Empress Eugénie, together with the dethroned
emperor and the young Prince Imperial, were equally the
recipients of her pity and sympathy. Strange vicissitudes
of fortune! During the Crimean War, the emperor
and empress of the French had visited Queen Victoria,
their royal ally.</p>

<p>“How strange,” says the queen’s journal, “that I, the
granddaughter of George III., should dance with Emperor
Napoleon, nephew of England’s greatest enemy,
now my most intimate and nearest ally, only six years
ago, living in this country an exile, poor and unthought
of!”</p>

<p>This visit was afterwards returned by Queen Victoria
and the Prince Consort, when they were received by Napoleon
III. with great magnificence in Paris, and attended
there the <i>Grande Exposition;</i> as the French were the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
to follow the example of the English in the great World’s
Exhibition, which had been originally conceived of by
Prince Albert, when he devised the famous Crystal
Palace.</p>

<p>This great International Exhibition, inaugurated and
carried out by Prince Albert, this first Crystal Palace of
the world, of which the Paris Exposition, and others of
the kind, have been copies, some on a larger scale, but
none of equal beauty, is best described in Queen Victoria’s
own words:—</p>

<p>“The glimpse of the transept through the iron gates,
the waving palms, flowers, statues, myriads of people
filling the galleries and seats around, with the flourish of
trumpets as we entered, gave us a sensation I can never
forget, and I felt much moved. We went for a moment
to a little side-room, where we left our shawls, and where
we found mamma and Mary, and outside which were
standing the other princes. In a few seconds we proceeded,
Albert leading me, having Vicky at his hand and
Bertie holding mine. The sight, as we came to the middle,
where the steps and chair (which I did <i>not</i> sit on)
were placed, with the beautiful crystal fountain just in
front of it, was magical—so vast, so glorious, so touching.
One felt, as so many did whom I have since spoken
to, filled with devotion, more so than by any service I
have ever heard,—the tremendous cheers; the joy expressed
in every face; the immensity of the building; the
mixture of palms, flowers, trees, statues, fountains; the
organ (with two hundred instruments, and six hundred
voices, which sounded like nothing); and my beloved
husband, the author of this Peace Festival, which united
the industry of all nations of the earth. All this was
moving indeed, and it was and is a day to live forever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
God bless my dearest Albert! God bless my dearest
country, which has shown itself so great to-day! One
felt grateful to the great God, who seemed to pervade all
and to bless all! The only event it in the slightest degree
reminded me of was the Coronation, but this day’s festival
was a thousand times superior. In fact, it is unique,
and can bear no comparison, from its peculiar beauty and
combination of such striking and different objects. I
mean the slight resemblance only as to its solemnity; the
enthusiasm and cheering, too, were much more touching,
for in a church naturally all is silent.... That we felt
happy, thankful, I need not say; proud of all that had
passed, of my darling husband’s success, and of the
behavior of my good people.”</p>

<p>Thus did the queen gracefully acknowledge her indebtedness
to the devoted husband, who, refusing all titles but
that of Prince Consort, spent his life in ministering to
her greatness, and consecrated his superior talents of
mind in unostentatiously smoothing the difficulties in her
royal path. Prince Albert would, without doubt, have
made one of the best and most beneficent rulers that England
ever had, if he had been the sovereign; it was to his
wise head and clear judgment that Victoria was indebted
for many of the popular measures of her government during
his life; and his loss was indeed irreparable. And
her constant devotion to his memory is a more noble
tribute to him than the magnificent memorial erected by
her in his honor, even though the inscription reads:—</p>

<div class="center">
To The Beloved Memory<br>
<small>OF</small><br>
ALBERT, THE GREAT AND GOOD PRINCE CONSORT.<br>
Raised by his Broken-Hearted Widow<br>
VICTORIA R.<br>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span></p>

<p>Charlotte M. Yonge, in her recent “Jubilee Book,”
“The Victorian Half-Century,” gives the following incident:—</p>

<p>“We have a charming picture of domestic life in the
letters of the great musical composer Mendelssohn, who
was in England in the summer of 1842. ‘Prince Albert
had asked me to go to him on Saturday, at two o’clock,
that I might try his organ before I left England. I found
him alone, and as we were talking away, the queen came
in, also alone, in a simple morning dress. She said she
was obliged to leave for Claremont in an hour, and then
suddenly interrupting herself, exclaimed, “But, goodness!
what a confusion!” For the wind had littered
the whole room, and even the pedals of the organ (which,
by the way, made a very pretty feature of the room),
with leaves of music from a large portfolio that lay open.
As she spoke she knelt down and began picking up the
music; Prince Albert helped, and I, too, was not idle.
Then Prince Albert proceeded to explain the stops to me,
and she said that she would meanwhile put things straight.
I begged that the prince would first play me something,
that I might boast about it in Germany, and he played
a chorale, by heart, with the pedals, so charmingly and
clearly and correctly that it would have done credit to
any professional; and the queen, having finished her
work, came and sat by him and listened, and looked
pleased. Then it was my turn, and I began my chorus
from “St. Paul,” “How lovely are the messengers.”
Before I got to the end of the first verse they had both
joined in the chorus, and all the time Prince Albert managed
the stops so cleverly for me,... and all by heart,
that I was really quite enchanted. Then the young
Prince of Gotha came in, and there was more chatting,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
and the queen asked if I had written any new songs, and
said she was very fond of singing my published ones.
“You should sing one to him,” said Prince Albert, and
after a little begging, she said she would try the “<i>Frühlingslied</i>”
in B flat, “if it is still here,” she added, “for all
my music is packed for Claremont.” Prince Albert went
to look for it, but came back, saying it was already packed.
“But one might, perhaps, unpack it,” said I. “We must
send for Lady ——,” she said (I did not catch the name).
So the bell was rung, and the servants were sent after it;
but without success, and at last the queen went herself,
and whilst she was gone, Prince Albert said to me, “She
begs you will accept this present as a remembrance,” and
gave me a case with a beautiful ring, on which is engraved
“V. R., 1842.” Then the queen came back, and
said, “Lady —— is gone, and has taken all my things
with her. It is really most annoying.”’</p>

<p>“However, Mendelssohn begged that he might not be
the sufferer, and after some consultation, Prince Albert
said, ‘She will sing you something of Gluck’s.’ Then
they proceeded to the queen’s sitting-room, where there
stood by the piano a mighty rocking-horse and two
great bird-cages. The walls were decorated with pictures;
beautifully bound books lay on the tables, and
music on the piano. Mendelssohn found among the
music a set of songs of his own, and, first sending away
the parrot, ‘for he will scream louder than I can sing,’
the queen sang ‘<i>Schöner und Schöner schmückt sie</i>’ quite
charmingly, in strict time and tune, but with one slight
error. Mendelssohn confessed that the song was not his,
but his sister Fanny’s, and she then, with some doubt,
undertook to try to sing his ‘<i>Pilger Spruch, Lass dich
nur</i>,’ which she did quite faultlessly, and with charming
feeling and expression.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span></p>

<p>“Mendelssohn says: ‘I thought to myself, one must
not pay too many compliments on such an occasion, so I
merely thanked her a great many times; on which she
said, “Oh! if only I had not been so frightened; generally
I have such a long breath.” Then I praised her heartily
and with the best conscience in the world, for just that
part, with the long C at the close, she had done so well,
and taking the three notes next to it all in the same
breath, as one seldom hears it done, and therefore it
amused me doubly that she herself should have begun
about it.’ Afterwards the prince sang ‘<i>Es ist ein Schnitter</i>,’
and Mendelssohn improvised till it was time for her
Majesty to start for Claremont.”</p>

<p>Madame de Bunsen, the English wife of the Prussian
ambassador, thus described Queen Victoria:—</p>

<p>“She is the only piece of female royalty I ever saw
who was also a creature such as God Almighty has created.
Her smile is a real smile, her grace is natural;
although it has received a high polish from cultivation,
there is nothing artificial about her.”</p>

<p>Her present appearance is thus given: “Queen Victoria
possesses a short, stout figure; a face with the long
upper lip, and cold, blue eyes of the Georges; straight
bandeaus of gray hair; a rather flushed complexion; a
most graceful walk; and a sort of sweet, venerable, natural
dignity and power about her.”</p>

<p>On the first of January, 1876, Queen Victoria was proclaimed
Empress of India.</p>

<p>The first wedding among her children was the marriage
of her eldest daughter, the Princess Victoria, to Frederick
William, now the Crown Prince of Germany. The queen
herself thus writes in her diary: “Went to look at the
rooms prepared for Vicky’s honeymoon. Very pretty!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
It quite agitated me to look at them.” And again, regarding
the ceremony, she writes: “My last fear of being
overcome vanished on seeing Vicky’s quiet, calm, and
composed manner. It was beautiful to see her kneeling
with Fritz, their hands joined, and the train borne by the
eight young ladies, who looked like a cloud of maidens
hovering round her.”</p>

<p>So royal mothers are akin to other mothers when they
witness the wedding ceremonies of their children. The
Princess Alice was the next to marry; but as her marriage
occurred soon after her father’s death, the wedding
was very quiet. This lovely princess was the favorite of
the family. She seemed to inherit a large portion of her
lamented father’s tastes and traits; and as the wife of
Prince Louis of Hesse, won all hearts. Her sad death,
from malignant diphtheria, which dread disease had just
snatched away a darling little daughter, is remembered by
all. Since her death, the queen has lost another child,
her youngest son, Leopold, Duke of Albany.</p>

<p>The heir to the throne, the Prince of Wales, married
the beautiful and charming Princess Alexandra of Denmark.
Many have seen her fascinating face, and English
people love to greet her and receive her gracious smiles.
Of the sweet Princess of Wales, all speak in lavish terms
of praise. The other children of Queen Victoria are: the
Princess Helena, married to Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein;
Princess Louise, now Marquise of Lorne;
Princess Beatrice, lately married to Prince Henry of Battenberg;
Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, married to
the daughter of the Czar Alexander II. of Russia, she
being sister to the present czar; and Prince Arthur, Duke
of Connaught, who married the Princess Marguerite of
Prussia, daughter of Prince Frederick Charles of Prussia,
called the Red Prince.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[495]</a></span>The 21st of June, 1887, was the fiftieth anniversary of
Queen Victoria’s ascension to the throne of England.
The occasion was celebrated by an imposing Jubilee.
But this gorgeous celebration was surpassed ten years
later by her Diamond Jubilee, when the whole nation
seemed given up to rejoicing and pageantry.</p>

<p>Only one event was more impressive than that great
occasion; it was the funeral of the good Queen, on February
3, 1901. She passed away on January 22, after a
reign of sixty-three years, the longest of any English
sovereign. At her own request, the funeral was a military
one. The royal catafalque was placed on board the
<i>Alberta</i>, which passed between long lines of warships
whose flags were half-masted, and whose crews lined the
decks with their arms at “attention.” Upon land, the
coffin was placed on a khaki-colored gun carriage, and
was followed through the streets of London by a solemn
procession headed by the Queen’s son, the new monarch,
Edward VII, and her grandson, Emperor William of
Germany. Minute guns and the tolling of bells announced
the progress of the funeral train.</p>

<p>Within the grounds of Frogmore House, adjoining
Windsor Castle, the Queen had erected a mausoleum for
the Prince Consort; and there by his side she was laid
to rest. The epitaph written by the Queen herself
reads:—</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
